I've launched a website where I document my English learning journey!

I mainly utilize [Engoo](https://engoo.com/app/materials/en)'s resources, which are freely available for personal use and are tailored for English learners.   
In particular, [Engoo's describing picture material](https://engoo.com/app/materials/describing-pictures/P_HriMOnEeifo0O-yMP42w) contains a wide variety of photos and I use them for improving my English.

My primary goal right now is to become proficient at spontaneously describing what’s depicted in those images in English.
I understand that mastering this skill overnight is unrealistic.

I used to read news articles and English learning materials every day for about a year, but I realized I was just going through the motions without absorbing much content.   
It became clear that I wouldn't learn to speak in my own words anytime soon.   
So, I decided to change my approach.  
Now, I'm fully committed to thinking and speaking in English.  
I’ve been working on dividing and condensing it into short speeches within one minute, memorizing the script, and then recording myself delivering the speech without reading it.

Through this practice, I've found myself expressing the scripts much more actively in my own words in English, rather than simply reading something written by someone else.  
And I want to break the habit of thinking in Japanese and start thinking and speaking in English, with proper grammar.

Currently, I can only speak English still haltingly, but I've noticed some improvement in my pronunciation when I listen back to my recorded speeches, even for native English speakers.  
In preparation for recording these short English speeches, I’ve been thoroughly rehearsing the script, using AI-generated voice narration to mimic a natural delivery until I can confidently reproduce the speech.

Thanks to this approach, I’ve been able to establish an environment where I can create scripts, extract narration audio, and practice speeches using useful free websites and software.  
I hope to share these tips with others who might find it beneficial.

I'd be delighted if you're interested in checking out my website.  
Thank you very much for sticking around till the end!
