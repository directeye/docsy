I've launched a website where I document my English learning journey!

I mainly utilize [Engoo](https://engoo.com/app/materials/en)'s resources, which are freely available for personal use and are tailored for English learners.   
In particular, [Engoo's describing picture material](https://engoo.com/app/materials/describing-pictures/P_HriMOnEeifo0O-yMP42w) contains a wide variety of photos and I use them for improve my English.  
My immediate aim is to become proficient at spontaneously describing what's depicted those images in English.   
I understand that achieving that goal instantly is unrealistic.   
Therefore, I've been working on dividing or condensing it into a short speech within one minute, memorizing the script, and recording myself delivering the speech without reading the script.

Through this practice, I aim to stop thinking in Japanese and instead understand and speak in English word order.  
Currently, I can only speak English somewhat haltingly, but I feel like my pronunciation might have improved a bit when I listen back to my memorized and recorded speeches, even to a native English speaker.  

In preparation for recording these English short speeches, I've been thoroughly rehearsing the script using AI-generated voice narration to mimic a natural delivery until I can faithfully reproduce the speech.  

Thanks to this approach, I've been able to establish an environment where I can create scripts, extract narration audio, and practice speeches using useful free websites and software.   
I hope to share these tips with others who might find it beneficial.

I'd be delighted if you're interested in checking out my website.  
Thank you very much for sticking around till the end!
