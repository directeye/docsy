I've launched a website where I document my English learning journey!

I mainly utilize [Engoo](https://engoo.com/app/materials/en)'s resources, which are freely available for personal use and are tailored for English learners.   
In particular, [Engoo's describing picture material](https://engoo.com/app/materials/describing-pictures/P_HriMOnEeifo0O-yMP42w) contains a wide variety of photos and I use them for improving my English.  
My primary goal right now is to become proficient at spontaneously describing what's depicted in those images in English.   
I understand that mastering this skill overnight is unrealistic.   
Therefore, I've been working on dividing and condensing it into short speeches within one minute, memorizing the script, and recording myself delivering the speech without reading it.

Through this practice, I aim to stop thinking in Japanese and instead understand and speak English gramatically correct.  
Currently, I can only speak English somewhat haltingly, but I feel like my pronunciation has improved a bit when I listen to my memorized and recorded speeches, even to a native English speaker.  

In preparation for recording these short English speeches, I've been thoroughly rehearsing the script using AI-generated voice narration to mimic a natural delivery until I can faithfully reproduce the speech.  

Thanks to this approach, I've been able to establish an environment where I can create scripts, extract narration audio, and practice speeches using useful free websites and software.   
I hope to share these tips with others who might find it beneficial.

I'd be delighted if you're interested in checking out my website.  
Thank you very much for sticking around till the end!
