In my previous post, I explained how to extract the narration audio as an MP3 file.   
Now, I'll explain how create my own speech videos by mimicking the narration. 

## Using Software

I use the following free software:


| Software | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Audipo](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/audipo-%E5%80%8D%E9%80%9F%E5%86%8D%E7%94%9F-%E8%80%B3%E3%82%B3%E3%83%94-%E3%83%AA%E3%82%B9%E3%83%8B%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%81%AB/id607971056) (only in Japanese) | An audio player app for smartphones that allows speed adjustments and repeat settings. |
| [VLC media player](https://www.videolan.org/index.html) | A media player for desktop PCs that lets you adjust video speed and set repeat settings.</br> It can also control MP3 audio files without video. |
| iPhone Camera App | To record my speech. |
| [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) | For uploading and sharing videos. |

I'll spare the detailed setup and operation instructions for each software here.

After extracting the narration audio, I use Audipo or VLC media player to adjust the playback speed and practice my speech.   
I keep practicing until I can accurately replicate the narration.

The image above shows my script narration audio playing at 90% speed in the Audipo app.  
I also insert yellow triangle markers to separate each sentence.

If I encounter unfamiliar expressions or parts that are too fast, I use the A-B section repeat function to slow down the playback and practice those sections until they feel natural and I can say them accurately.

Finally, I record my speech on my iPhone without relying on the script or narration audio.   
I then upload the video to YouTube and set it to 'unlisted' so only people with the URL can view it.   
I prefer not to broadcast my videos widely.

This training method might take some time, but thoroughly practicing and recording these videos is a great way to track my progress.   
I believe that with this effort, I will eventually be able to speak English spontaneously and confidently in my own words.
