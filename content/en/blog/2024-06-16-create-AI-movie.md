I’m working on my English skills by describing scenes in photos with a one-minute speech in English.   
Today, I tried creating an AI video using a script I wrote.

[The script for the 2nd photo from Engoo Lesson 8](https://directeye.github.io/docsy/docs/engoo_photos/intermediate/lesson08/#exercise-2-eating-an-ice-cream) is what I input into the [Luma Dream Machine](https://lumalabs.ai/dream-machine) prompt.  
I’m reposting my script here:

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
In this arresting photo, a young woman holds a mixed vanilla-strawberry ice cream in a waffle cone. <br/>
She looks stylish as she strikes a playful pose with a slight lift of her left shoulder. <br/>
Her oversized sunglasses with pink frames and pink-tinged mirrored lenses vividly reflect the scene before her. <br/>
A chunky pink chain necklace and a pink vest add charm to her overall look. <br/>
With her ash-blonde hair, she exudes a saucy aura that complements her pink-loving personality. <br/>
The blurry background suggests hills and fields with sunlight peeking through from behind. <br/>
Incidentally, after taking this picture, she probably intended to enjoy the tempting ice cream before it melted.<br/>

And the following image is the AI-generated video it produced:

For reference, [here](https://engoo.com/app/lessons/describing-pictures-intermediate-describing-pictures-daily-goods/yCuxtkp1Eeey-psCXzWe5w?category_id=P_HriMOnEeifo0O-yMP42w&course_id=ZZasjsOnEeiHZVOMC0VfdA#exercise-2)'s the original image I used to create the script.

The generated video was a bit different from what I envisioned, but I was amazed at how quickly it captured the essence of what I wanted.
