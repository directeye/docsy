### Utilizing ChatGPT

I usually draft a one-minute speech script derived from Engoo's describing picture material.  
Those scripts can be found on my website under "[Scirpts for Engoo describing pictures](/docsy/docs/engoo_photos/)."

When preparing a script for a photo description speech, the content is first written out in Japanese in order to describe the details of the photograph in detail.  
Verbalise the clothing and behaviour of the people in the photo, or the situation of the objects.  
I also include comments expressing my opinions and thoughts based on the photo to complete the script.  

Once the script is written in Japanese, I use [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to translate it into English.

### How to create translation script into English

To instruct ChatGPT for translation, use the following command:

```
‚Äùwrite the photo description script in Japanese here"
translate the script within the quotes above into English as a native speaker would say
```

When left as translated, the script often lacks natural English expressions.   
So, I engage in dialogues like the following with ChatGPT to make the script more natural.

### How to accquire natural expression from ChatGPT

If I repeatedly provide the same instructions to a prompt, the resulting translation may vary each time.   
I frequently put together a script with the best of the wording I want to adopt.

If I'm looking for more natural expressions, I'll provide the following instructions:  

```
"write the translated script here"
change the script within the quotes above more naturally to make it easier to hear
```

### How to summarize the script

If the script gets a bit long and can't fit into a one-minute speech, I'll give the following instructions:

```
"write the translated script here"
condense the script within the quotes to less than 120 words
```

### How to divide the script into multiple parts

If the script becomes too long and needs to be split into two one-minute speech scripts, I'll provide the following instructions: 

```
"write the translated script here"
devide the script within the quotes into two parts
```

I'm experimenting like this to compile a script with more natural English expressions.
