I usually draft one-minute speech scripts derived from [Engoo's describing pictures material](https://engoo.com/app/materials/describing-pictures/P_HriMOnEeifo0O-yMP42w).  
Those scripts can be found on my website under the section titled "[Scripts for Engoo describing pictures](/docsy/docs/engoo_photos/)."

## Drafting Detailed Photo Description Script


When preparing a script for a photo description speech, I start by writing out the details in Japanese to make sure I capture all the nuances of the image.  
I verbalise the clothing and behaviour of the people in the photo, or the situation of the objects.  
I also include comments expressing my own opinions and thoughts based on the photo to complete the script.  

## Utilizing ChatGPT

Once the script is written in Japanese, I use [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) to translate it into English.

### Creating English Translation Scripts

To instruct ChatGPT for translation, use the following prompt:

```
‚Äùwrite the photo description script in Japanese here"
translate the script within the quotes above into English as a native speaker would say
```

### Getting Natural English Expression

When I leave the script as-is after translation, it tends to lose the natural flow of English.   
That's why I have conversations like the one below with ChatGPT to refine it and make it sound more natural. 

On the other hand, I've noticed that even when I provide the same instructions repeatedly, the resulting translation can vary each time.   
So, I've compiled a script with the wording I find most suitable. 

When I'm aiming for even greater naturalness, I'll provide the following prompt:

```
"write the translated script here"
change the script within the quotes above more naturally to make it easier to hear
```

### Script Summarization

If the script gets a bit long and can't fit into a one-minute speech, I'll give the following prompt:

```
"write the translated script here"
condense the script within the quotes to less than 120 words
```

To create a headline for the article, I provide the following prompt:

```
"write the script here"
shorten the above sentence into a headline-like format
```

### Dividing Script into Parts

If the script becomes too long and needs to be split into two one-minute speech scripts, I'll provide the following prompt: 

```
"write the translated script here"
divide the script within the quotes into two parts
```

I'm experimenting like this to compile a script with more natural English expressions.
