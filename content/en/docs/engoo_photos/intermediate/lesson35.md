## Exercise 1: Jumping on the Bed

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo captures a young boy jumping on his bed. <br/>
He's blonde, wearing a short-sleeved white shirt and jeans. <br/>
Crouched with his knees bent and leaning forward, it looks like he's just launched himself into the air. <br/>
Behind him, at the head of the bed, there's a teddy bear, suggesting it might be his cuddle buddy at night. <br/>
The whole room is white, with white curtains, window blinds, a picture frame, a lamp shade on a standing light, and a bedside chest of drawers.<br/>
If you look closely, there's an alarm clock on top of the chest. <br/>
It's a bit surprising for a child's room to be all white, considering he might scribble on the walls. <br/>
Maybe he shares the room with his parents.<br/>
