## Exercise 1: Jumping on the Bed

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo captures a young blond headed boy jumping on his bed. <br/>
He's wearing a short-sleeved white shirt and a pair of jeans. <br/>
Crouched with his knees bent and leaning forward, it looks like he's just launched himself into the air. <br/>
Behind him, at the head of the bed, there's a teddy bear, suggesting it might be his cuddle buddy at night. <br/>
The whole room is white, with white curtains, window blinds, a picture frame on the wall, a standing light with a lamp shade, and a bedside chest of drawers.<br/>
If you look closely, there's an alarm clock on top of the chest. <br/>
It's a bit surprising for a child's room to be all white, considering he might scribble on the walls. <br/>
Maybe he shares the room with his parents.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Sunflowers

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a little girl taking in the scent of a big sunflower. <br/>
She's holding the thick stem and has pulled the large yellow bloom right up to her face. <br/>
With her eyes closed, she's inhaling deeply, using the tip of her nose to feel the texture of the seeds.<br/>
The background is blurry, but you can tell she's standing in a field absolutely covered in bright sunflowers. <br/>
The ones surrounding her seem just a bit taller than her height.<br/>
Her light green sundress and the vibrant sunflower field in full bloom really give off that peak summer feeling. <br/>
She must be soaking up a lot of energy and joy from these cheerful flowers.<br/>
