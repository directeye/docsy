## Exercise 1: Jumping on the Bed

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a blond-haired young boy mid-jump on his bed.<br/>
He's wearing a white short-sleeved shirt and jeans.<br/>
He looks like he just launched himself into the air, with his knees bent and leaning forward. <br/>
Behind him, a teddy bear sits at the head of the bed, likely his cuddle buddy at night. <br/>
The room is all white, with white curtains, window blinds, a picture frame on the wall, a standing lamp with a shade, and a bedside chest of drawers. <br/>
On top of the chest, there's an alarm clock. <br/>
It’s surprising for a child’s room to be all white, considering he might scribble on the walls. <br/>
Maybe he shares the room with his parents.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Sunflowers

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a little girl taking in the scent of a big sunflower. <br/>
She's holding the thick stem and has pulled the large golden bloom right up to her face. <br/>
With her eyes closed, she's inhaling deeply, using the tip of her nose to feel the texture of the seeds.<br/>
The background is blurry, but you can tell she's standing in a field that is completely covered in bright sunflowers.<br/>
The ones surrounding her seem just a bit taller than she is.<br/>
Her light green sundress and the vibrant sunflower field in full bloom really give off that peak summer feeling. <br/>
She must be soaking up a lot of energy and joy from these cheerful flowers.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Balloons

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo captures a little girl in a bright red dress who appears as if she's being lifted off the ground by a cluster of soaring colorful balloons.<br/>
She's standing on her tiptoes on top of a hill, with one leg stretched out behind her as if she's floating.<br/> 
Her arms are stretched high, as if being pulled by the strings of the helium balloons. <br/>
Her expression suggests she might truly take flight, with her face turned towards the balloons as they drift higher into the sky.<br/>
The crisp blue sky is streaked with wispy white clouds, and the breeze seems to be carrying the balloons ever upward.<br/>
While the helium balloons cannot actually lift her body, the photo masterfully gives the impression that she might really float away.<br/>
