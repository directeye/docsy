## Exercise 1: Shopping with Friends

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into three parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows three cheerful young women leaving the shops after a fun shopping trip. <br/>
They’re all dressed in brimmed hats, mirrored sunglasses, and colorful summer outfits, and they’re carrying a variety of vibrant shopping bags.<br/>
Let’s focus on the woman on the left. <br/>
She has lovely blonde hair that complements her pink floral top beautifully.<br/>
Over her right arm, she's draped a small light blue shopping bag and another bag with an eye-catching geometric pattern featuring zigzags.<br/>
She’s also holding a credit card in that hand, so she might have paid for all their purchases.<br/>
If that’s the case, she could be the mother, and the two women next to her are probably her daughters.<br/>
<br/>
I'll stop here, as the explanation is quite long.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
Let's take a closer look at the woman in the center. <br/>
Her long brown hair drapes over her back and she’s wearing a pale pink cardigan over a white layered mini dress, paired with a matching hat.<br/>
Her mirrored aviator sunglasses add a stylish touch. <br/>
What's particularly interesting is her choice of shopping bags. <br/>
She's carrying a light blue one that's identical to the bag her blonde haired mother on the left is holding. <br/>
Along with that, she has another bag with a geometric pattern that is similar to her mother's shopping bag. <br/>
Both bags are casually hanging over her right shoulder as she smiles at the camera.<br/>
The matching bags are quite intriguing.<br/>
It looks like they may have shopped at the same boutique.<br/>

{{<card header="**3rd script**">}}
Lastly, the woman on the right, with long brown hair, is rocking a straw hat and the same aviator sunglasses as the woman in the middle.<br/> 
She’s dressed in white shorts and a pink patterned top, with silver bangle bracelets on both arms standing out. <br/>
In one hand, she’s holding a shopping bag with an orange and yellow circular design, and on the other shoulder, she’s carrying a large straw tote bag.<br/>
All three women look incredibly stylish and full of energy. <br/>
It’s clear they must have spent some time in the fitting room picking out outfits and accessories that suit them perfectly. <br/>
You can really tell they've been out on the town, enjoying a fun shopping spree.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Good Morning!

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo captures a woman stretching in a king-size bed on a sun-drenched morning. <br/>
Wraparound windows flood the room with light, hinting she may have slept in. <br/>
The lack of curtains reveals glimpses of nearby buildings, suggesting an urban or suburban setting.<br/>
<br/>
Crisp white bedding adorns the bed, complete with a smooth comforter and pillows. <br/>
A sleek leather headboard doubles as a cozy backrest, while a matching dark bedside table topped with a modern lamp adds a chic touch.<br/>
<br/>
The woman, wearing comfortable-looking pajamas, lies in the middle of the spacious bed. <br/>
Her arms are stretched above her head, and a slight smile plays on her face. <br/>
The bright, airy room and her relaxed posture create a sense of calm, promising a refreshing start of the day.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Under a Tree

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
This image captures a boy engrossed in reading outdoors in a peaceful setting. <br/>
He sits beneath a massive, majestic tree with a thick trunk and wide-spread branches.<br/>
Dressed in casual summer clothes, including a light-colored shirt and blue shorts, he also wears a hat. <br/>
The boy leans comfortably with his back against the tree, and his knees slightly raised to support his book. <br/>
In the foreground, a field of orange and yellow flowers stretches out. <br/>
Lush greenery extends beyond the central tree, with the distant trees and leaves adding depth to the scene.<br/>
Sunlight filters through the trees, gently illuminating the boy, creating the perfect soft light for him to enjoy reading in this beautiful outdoor environment.<br/>
