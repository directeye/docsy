## Exercise 1: Shopping with Friends

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into three parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows three cheerful young women leaving the shops after a fun shopping trip. <br/>
They’re all dressed in wide-brimmed hats, mirrored sunglasses, and colorful summer outfits, and they’re carrying a variety of vibrant shopping bags.<br/>
Let’s focus on the woman on the left. <br/>
She has lovely blonde hair that complements her pink floral top beautifully.<br/>
Over her right arm, she's draped a small light blue shopping bag and another bag with an eye-catching geometric pattern featuring zigzag details.<br/>
She’s also holding a credit card in that hand, so she might have paid for all their purchases.<br/>
If that’s the case, she could be their mother, with the two women next to her being her daughters.<br/>
<br/>
I'll stop here, as the explanation is quite long.<br/>

Let's take a closer look at the woman in the center. <br/>
Her long brown hair frames her face beautifully, and she’s wearing a vibrant matching top and skirt, paired with a matching hat.<br/>
Her mirrored aviator sunglasses she's wearing add a stylish touch. <br/>
What's particularly interesting is her choice of shopping bags. <br/>
She's carrying a light blue one that's identical to the bag her blonde friend on the left is holding. <br/>
Along with that, she has another bag with a similar geometric pattern. <br/>
Both are casually draped over her right shoulder, held in her right hand.<br/>
The matching bags are quite intriguing.<br/>
It looks like they may have shopped at the same boutique.<br/>

{{<card header="**3rd script**">}}
Lastly, the woman on the right, with long brown hair, is rocking a straw hat and the same aviator sunglasses as the woman in the middle.<br/> 
She’s dressed in white shorts and a pink patterned top, with silver bangles on both arms standing out. <br/>
In one hand, she’s holding a shopping bag with an orange and yellow circular design, and on the other shoulder, she’s carrying a large straw basket-style bag.<br/>
All three women look incredibly stylish and full of energy. <br/>
It’s clear they must have spent some time in the fitting room picking out outfits and accessories that suit them perfectly. <br/>
You can really tell they've been out on the town, enjoying a fun shopping spree.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Good Morning!

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a woman stretching in bed on a bright, sunny morning. <br/>
Large windows wrap around the bedroom, flooding it with natural light. <br/>
Since it's already bright, she may have slept in. <br/>
With no curtains, you can see parts of other buildings outside, suggesting an urban or suburban setting.<br/>
<br/>
The bed is dressed in crisp white bedding with a plush comforter and pillows. <br/>
The sleek leather headboard adds a cozy touch and serves as a comfortable backrest. <br/>
A matching dark bedside table and modern lamp complete the chic look.<br/>
<br/>
Wearing a light-colored, comfy nightgown, the woman smiles slightly and stretches her arms above her head. <br/>
The bright, airy room and her relaxed morning create a calm, refreshing start to the day.<br/>
