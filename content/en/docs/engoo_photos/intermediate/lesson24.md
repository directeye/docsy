{{% pageinfo %}}
This script is devided into two parts.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo captures a heartwarming scene between a young girl and her mother, sharing a delicious strawberry ice cream with a waffle cone. <br/>
They're both playfully sticking out their tongues as they lick the melting treat, exchanging warm smiles. <br/>
Upon closer inspection, gentle wrinkles around the mother's eyes reveal her affectionate gaze. <br/>
<br/>
The girl has bright blonde hair, styled in shoulder-length curls with bangs delicately covering her forehead.<br/>
She's dressed in a charming blue and white striped sundress, holding the ice cream cone firmly in her right hand. <br/>
Meanwhile, the mother sports wavy reddish-blonde hair cascading down her shoulders and gracefully revealing her forehead.<br/>
She's wearing a collared shirt with slim vertical light blue and white stripes, with a few buttons left open for comfort.<br/>

Let's delve into the scene and its surroundings.<br/>
The sight of melting ice cream trickling down the waffle cone implies a sweltering afternoon.<br/>
Behind the mother and daughter stands a two-story cream-colored building, possibly a hotel or a shopping mall. <br/>
On the ground level, a window adorned with white curtains on the girl's side hints at a potential shop, while a spacious door on the mother's side appears to be the entrance to the building.<br/>
Looking upward, the second floor is adorned with green ivy leaves, adding natural beauty. <br/>
An ivy canopy extends from the white signboard with orange letters in the upper right corner, offering a cool respite from the sun.<br/>
Below, a bench with a green backrest invites passersby to take a break and enjoy the surroundings.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Decisions...

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
In the photo, there's a woman with long dark brown hair wearing a vibrant red dress, standing in the toiletry aisle of the pharmacy, looking like she's searching for something. <br/>
She's dressed in a bright red fit and flare dress with half sleeves and a scoop neck.<br/>
The ceiling of the toiletry aisle has long straight fluorescent lights hanging, illuminating the shelves brightly. <br/>
Though the toiletry shelves are a bit blurry, it looks like they've got a large variety of sanitary products, toilet paper, and detergents.<br/>
Leaning on her shopping cart with both elbows, she holds a shopping list in her left hand, while her right hand lightly rests on her chin, her eyes fixed on the shelves to her right. <br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
Now, moving on to sharing my assumptions.<br/>
<br/>
She seems to be contemplating whether to buy something, checking her list, but it seems that she's still on the fence.<br/>
Perhaps her desired brand is unavailable, or maybe the item she desires lacks a discounted price tag.<br/>
<br/>
What stands out is that she doesn't appear to have a bag, and her outfit doesn't have any visible pockets, suggesting she might not have her purse with her. <br/>
Payment could be intended through a smartphone or credit card if she has them. <br/>
Since there's no reusable bag in the shopping cart either, she might be planning to buy disposable plastic bags at the checkout.<br/>
Alternatively, the absence of rings suggests she's unmarried, perhaps with a boyfriend elsewhere in the pharmacy.<br/>

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The vibrant photo captures a little girl sitting on a lawn, devouring a slice of watermelon. <br/>
She is wearing a pinkish-red and white checkered sundress, sitting barefoot with her legs stretched out. <br/>
Her light blonde hair cascades in shoulder-length curls, with bangs pinned back by a red hair clip, exposing her forehead. <br/>
The color of her dress and hair clip harmonizes with the lively red of the watermelon.<br/>
With both hands, she relishes the oversized slice, her gaze wandering into the distance. <br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll break here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
Let's take a closer look at the little girl enjoying the watermelon.<br/>
Curiously, despite her enthusiastic indulgence, there's no trace of juice or seeds on her face or hands. <br/>
Maybe she was hastily handed the watermelon for the photo shoot. <br/>
However, the soles of her feet give away her messy endeavor because they are stained by the watermelon's juices.<br/>
Perhaps she unwittingly stepped on some juicy bits before settling down. <br/>
Behind her are three whole and one partially cut watermelon.<br/>
Meanwhile, white Dutch clovers casually bloom near her feet and gentle sunlight beams down, casting a warm glow on the lush green grass while the watermelons evoke the essence of early summer.<br/>
