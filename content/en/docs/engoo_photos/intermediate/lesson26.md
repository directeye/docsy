## Exercise 1: Playing Doctor

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
A little girl in the photo is in what seems to be her playroom, pretending to be a doctor while giving a check-up to her teddy bear.<br/> 
With short blonde pigtails, she wears blue patterned pajamas with a white bib, mimicking a blue lab coat and white apron.<br/>
Gently holding the teddy bear from behind, she listens intently to its heartbeat with a stethoscope, her serious expression simply adorable.<br/>
<br/>
Behind her, there’s a white two-tier shelf with round tin boxes in red, blue, and green, each labeled with the numbers 1, 2, and 3 in a large white font. <br/>
Nearby, you can see a pen holder filled with colorful pens, a rainbow bead abacus, and a rollercoaster bead maze. <br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll break here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video, I talked about the girl playing and the items on the shelf in the background. <br/>
Now, let me share my impression of the photo.<br/>
<br/>
The way she engages with her medical set, along with the presence of educational toys on the shelf, suggests she's growing up in an environment that values early learning and development. <br/>
Additionally, the glimpse of a potted plant with bright green leaves peeking in from the right side enhances the sense of a nurturing educational space.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, Japan's birthrate is declining and many households have only one child, so there must be a significant demand for this kind of gifted education to raise a single child with care.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Enjoying the Ride

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a dog enjoying the wind from the fully open rear left passenger window. <br/>
It's a clear, sunny day with big white clouds in the sky and lush, green trees lining the road, which create perfect conditions for a drive.<br/>
The brown dog in the car draws attention with its large, black muzzle. <br/>
With its eyes closed, it slightly opens its muzzle to feel the wind, revealing its oddly folded, wafer-thin, red tongue and prominent pointed canine teeth at the front. <br/>
Upon closer inspection, you can also notice a collar with stitches in the middle around its neck.<br/>
I'm sure people would have the same joyful expression as this dog when letting the wind hit their face by opening the car window.<br/>

## Exercise 3: A Walk in the Field

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo captures a woman walking through a wide meadow, clutching a bunch of yellow daisies in her right hand. <br/>
She's dressed in a white knee-length sleeveless dress, giving off a summer vibe. <br/>
The hem of her dress is edged with lace, and there are horizontal pleats around her waist. <br/>
Taking a closer look, she's wearing a bracelet on her left wrist. <br/>
Perhaps due to the strong wind, her long hair partially covers her face. <br/>
On her right, there's a patch of untouched grass, while the grassland behind her gently slopes upward.<br/>
It makes me wonder where she found those daisies, given that all around her we can only see lush, green grasslands.<br/>
