## Exercise 1: Arguments

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows a living room where two siblings are arguing while their mother sits helplessly on the couch and rests her forehead on her hands. <br/>
On the rug in front of the sofa, the brother and sister are seated cross-legged, dressed casually in T-shirts and jeans. <br/>
The brother is teasing his sister, pulling on his ears and sticking his tongue out playfully.<br/>
However, the sister is clearly not amused, with her arms folded tightly across her chest and an angry glare directed at her persistent brother. <br/>
Their mom is sitting on a white two-seater sofa, leaning forward with her elbows resting on her knees and her hands pressed against her forehead as she hangs her head.<br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll pause here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video, I talked about the heated argument between the brother and sister and how stressed their mother looked. <br/>
Now, let's talk about what we can infer from this image.<br/>
<br/>
The mother seems distressed, but sibling fights are common, especially among kids close in age.<br/>
I'm sure any parent with young children could relate to this image.<br/>
They're sitting about a meter apart, which suggests she may have tried to separate them. <br/>
Both kids seem strong-willed, so this argument could potentially turn into an all-out physical brawl.<br/>
Meanwhile, poor Mom looks like she's given up on stopping their bickering. <br/>
She probably feels like her advice isn't making any difference and is tired of dealing with their constant quarrels.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Burgers

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows a group of friends enjoying burgers at a restaurant.<br/>
It's hard to tell if they're seated inside or outside on a patio, and we're not sure if it's daytime or nighttime.<br/>
<br/>
On the wooden table in front of them there are glasses of beer, two burgers and piles of fries. <br/>
The food is served up on classic paper wrappers that are sitting on wooden trays. <br/>
It is clear that they've already had a few sips of beer by looking at the half-empty glasses.<br/>
So, it looks like the drinks came first and the food has just arrived. <br/>
They're about to start eating.<br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll pause here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
Now, let's see how the friends are acting.<br/>
<br/>
The two friends on the left and right in the center are both gripping their burgers with both hands, ready to dig in. <br/>
The one on the left still has a skewer in their burger, while the one on the right has removed theirs.<br/>
Up in the top right corner, someone has set aside a toothpick by the fries, but they're picking them up with their fingers instead.<br/>
The people on the upper left and bottom left seem to be reaching for their drinks.<br/>
Overall, it seems like a lively, friendly atmosphere. <br/>
Even though we can't see their faces, we can tell everyone’s having a great time, chatting and surely enjoying their meal with lots of smiles.<br/>

## Exercise 3: On the Balcony

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows a charming second-floor balcony overlooking a lush garden below. <br/>
Furnishing the balcony is a quaint round folding patio table with a steel frame and wooden top, paired with a slatted wooden folding garden chair. <br/>
The chair rests on a blue tasseled rug and is made cozy with a grid designed cushion and a light blue tasseled blanket draped over it. <br/>
Sitting on the table is an open thick book alongside three round potted plants, one of which is in bloom while the other two are houseplants.<br/>
Additionally, three more round potted plants are tucked away on the floor under the right side of the table.<br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll pause here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
Looking around the table on the second-floor balcony, you can see rectangular enamel planters brimming with flowering plants hanging from the stainless-steel railing in front of the table on either side. <br/>
The planter to the right particularly stands out, overflowing with its vibrant red, white, and purple blooms. <br/>
Down in the garden below, you'll see towering trees reaching their branches up toward the second story, with a lush green lawn and other blooming flowers scattered around. <br/>
Though the balcony may be compact, settling into the cozy seating arrangement with a cushioned chair, tasseled blanket, and a favorite book is irresistible.<br/>
Surrounded by verdant greenery and colorful flowers, it would undoubtedly make for a relaxing and delightful day.<br/>
