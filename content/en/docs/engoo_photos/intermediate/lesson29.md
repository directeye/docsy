## Exercise 1: Arguments

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows a living room where siblings are engaged in an argument, while their mother sits helplessly on the couch, holding her head.<br/>
On the rug in front of the sofa, the brother and sister are seated cross-legged on the floor, dressed casually in T-shirts and jeans. <br/>
The brother is teasing his sister, pulling on his ears and sticking his tongue out playfully.<br/>
However, the sister is clearly not amused, with her arms folded tightly across her chest and an angry glare directed at her persistent brother. <br/>
Their mom is sitting on a white two-seater sofa, leaning forward with her elbows resting on her knees, hands pressed against her forehead as she hangs her head down.<br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll pause here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video, I talked about the heated argument between the brother and sister and how stressed their mother looked. <br/>
Now, let's talk about what we can infer from this image.<br/>
<br/>
The mother seems distressed, but sibling fights are common, especially with kids close in age. <br/>
I'm sure any parent with young children could relate to this image.<br/>
They're sitting about a meter apart, which suggests she may have tried to separate them. <br/>
Both kids seem strong-willed, so this argument could potentially turn into an all-out physical brawl.<br/>
Meanwhile, poor Mom looks like she's given up on stopping their bickering. <br/>
She probably feels like her advice isn't making any difference and is tired of dealing with their constant quarrels.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Burgers

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows a group of friends enjoying burgers at a restaurant.<br/>
We can't quite tell if they're outside on a patio or inside, and whether it's daytime or nighttime.<br/>
<br/>
On the wooden table in front of them, there are glasses of beer, the burgers, and piles of fries. <br/>
The food is served up on the classic paper wrappers sitting on wooden trays. <br/>
Looking at the beer glasses, they've already had a few sips, so it looks like the drinks came first and the food just arrived. <br/>
They're about to start eating.<br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll pause here.<br/>
<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
Now, let's focus on how the friends are behaving.<br/>
<br/>
The two friends on the left and right in the center are both gripping their burgers with both hands, ready to dig in. <br/>
The one on the left still has the burger pick sticking out, while the one on the right has already removed theirs. <br/>
Up in the top right corner, someone has set aside a toothpick by the fries, but they're picking up a fry with their fingers instead.<br/>
The people on the upper left and bottom left seem to be reaching for their drinks.<br/>
Overall, it's a lively, friendly atmosphere. <br/>
Even though we can't see their faces, we can tell everyone’s having a great time, chatting and enjoying their meal with lots of smiles.<br/>
