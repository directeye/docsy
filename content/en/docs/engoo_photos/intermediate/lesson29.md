## Exercise 1: Arguments

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows a living room where siblings are engaged in an argument, while their mother sits helplessly on the couch, holding her head.<br/>
On the rug in front of the sofa, the brother and sister are seated cross-legged on the floor, dressed casually in t-shirts and jeans. <br/>
The brother is teasing his sister, pulling on his ears and sticking his tongue out playfully.<br/>
However, the sister is clearly not amused, with her arms folded tightly across her chest and an angry glare directed at her persistent brother. <br/>
Mom is sitting on a white two-seater sofa, elbows resting on her knees, hands pressed against her forehead as she hangs her head down.<br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll pause here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video, I talked about the heated argument between the brother and sister and how stressed their mother looked. <br/>
Now, let's talk about what we can infer from this image.<br/>
<br/>
The mother seems distressed, but sibling fights are common, especially with kids close in age. <br/>
They're sitting about a meter apart, which suggests she may have tried to separate them. <br/>
Both kids seem strong-willed, so this argument could potentially turn into an all-out physical brawl.<br/>
Meanwhile, poor Mom looks like she's given up on stopping their bickering. <br/>
She probably feels like her advice isn't making any difference and is tired of dealing with their constant quarrels.<br/>
