## Exercise 1: Problems...

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
In the photo, there's a young man in a bathroom wearing a white short-sleeved vest. <br/>
He seems rather crestfallen. <br/>
The bathroom walls are covered with turquoise mosaic tiles, and there's an arched wooden door behind him. <br/>
The room gives off a somber vibe, perhaps mirroring his weary and jaded mood. <br/>
He's leaning forward, with his cheek scrunched up into his right palm, perhaps he has just been dumped and is struggling with a sudden breakup. <br/>
Despite sporting some facial stubble and a stylish buzz cut, his emotions seem to overshadow his appearance. <br/>
He may be hoping that when he steps out of the bathroom, he can pull himself together and show a more confident and cheerful side of himself.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Cat's Eyes

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo captures a close-up of an American Shorthair cat with a surprised expression. <br/>
Its ears are laid back, and it has dilated, round, piercing pupils set in amber irises. <br/>
Unkempt white whiskers point in all directions, creating an unforgettable image. <br/>
The cat's mouth is agape, revealing a strangely folded, wafer-thin tongue, as if caught in a moment of shocked or dismayed yowling. <br/>
The close wall right behind the cat, with possibly no vertical escape route, gives the feeling of being trapped. <br/>
Perhaps, the cat was in hot pursuit of a mouse, only to have it slip away. <br/>
To make matters worse, it may have then unexpectedly run into a large, imposing dog, resulting in a moment of utter helplessness.<br/>

## Exercise 3: A Calm Evening

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
In the picture someone may be enjoying the sun's orange glow and stunning mountains.<br/>
Steam rises and wafts from the mug on the picnic table, filled with freshly brewed coffee.<br/>
I'm unsure if the sun's rising or setting, but the peaks and valleys are glowing in the sun's radiance.<br/>
The haze hanging in the distance adds to a magical vibe, giving me the urge to make a wish or something. <br/>
Incidentally, those bare patches on the nearby mountain might be exposed rock formations. <br/>
If I were there, savoring the marvelous mountain view, I would sip on my hot coffee. <br/>
And just a heads up, I get chilly easily, so once I polished off that coffee, I would probably head back indoors or to the car before I started freezing.<br/>
