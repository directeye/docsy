## Exercise 1: Stuck in Traffic

{{<alert>}}
This script is devided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
In the photo, we can see the division point of a highway where all the vehicles are stuck in a massive traffic jam. <br/>
The main road has 3 lanes going straight ahead, while another 2 lanes branch away and up an exit ramp.<br/>
Trees line both sides of the highway, and there's sunlight in the background, though the time of day is uncertain.<br/>
<br/>
The congestion appears to result from daily rush hour or holiday traffic rather than a traffic accident.<br/>
Despite the fact that some cars might be inching forward, I believe many drivers are feeling pretty frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
Now, here's something worth noting. <br/>
Motorcycles are cutting the queue by riding along the roadside and may also attempt to weave through the traffic.<br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I will break here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video, I talked about how the highway looked in the photo. <br/>
Initially, I thought it might be a traffic jam on a Japanese highway, but upon closer inspection, I couldn't spot any Japanese characters on the license plates, and the right-hand driving and left-side traffic flow suggested a different country.<br/>
<br/>
Now, let me explain the highway situation in Japan. <br/>
Rush hour in Japan can lead to traffic jams spanning 5 to 10 miles, and during the holiday season, these traffic jams can stretch to a staggering 30 miles, taking over 2 hours to get through. <br/>
As someone who's been working from home and prefers a more relaxed lifestyle, I definitely steer clear of rush-hour car commutes and holiday season road trips.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Pizza

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a small-sized, thin-based, seafood pizza with delicious gooey cheese and perfectly golden-brown, crusty edges. <br/>
It's generously loaded with shrimp, octopus, and both red and white mussels.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like the pizza has been out of the oven for a little while because there's no steam rising from it, which indicates that it has cooled down a bit. <br/>
As one slice is served with the pizza lifter, the melted mozzarella cheese stretches gracefully, hinting at its lingering warmth.<br/>
<br/>
I absolutely love pizza, whether it's a fluffy thick base or a thin one with that crispy texture; I can't get enough of either one. <br/>
However, I do tend to devour it quickly, which poses a challenge for me given my weight concerns.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Beach Holiday

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
In the photo, there are four round thatched beach umbrellas securely anchored in the fine bleached white sand, casting a shadow over a pair of wooden slatted lounge chairs that come with white cushions.<br/>
Behind the beach umbrellas on the land side, there's a lush coastal forest stretching out.<br/>
Puffy cotton-like clouds lazily drift across the clear blue sky, creating a picturesque summer scene. <br/>
Upon closer inspection, in the distance we can see a circular pier connecting thatched roofed cottages perched on stilts above the tranquil azure sea.<br/>
<br/>
By escaping the daily grind and being surrounded by this resort paradise while savoring a leisurely pace, one can experience a truly exceptional and luxurious feeling of freedom and relaxation.<br/>
