## Exercise 1: Brushing Teeth with Mom

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows a young boy brushing his teeth in the bathroom, with his mother holding him. <br/>
The boy, dressed in a blue and white pinstriped short-sleeved pajamas, holds a dark orange toothbrush in his right hand, pressing it against his front teeth, and smiling confidently at the camera. <br/>
His mother, in a white blouse, squats beside him on his right, embracing his lower chest and appearing to offer him brushing advice while smiling. <br/>
Upon closer inspection, you can see rings on both of her ring fingers.<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll break here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video, I described the boy and his mother. <br/>
Now, let's take a look at their surroundings. <br/>
In front of them, there appears to be a door with a white and light green striped towel hanging on it. <br/>
Behind them is a sink, with two large mirrors above it, and water running from the faucet. <br/>
It's possible they were originally brushing at the sink behind them, but for the photo, the mother lifted him and moved to the other side, facing the camera for the boy to pose. <br/>
The mirror above the sink is slightly blurry, but it seems to reflect a kids' space with a light green floor.<br/>

## Exercise 2: All the Glamour

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
In the center of the photo, there's a woman who looks like a model posing while photographers surround her, flashing their cameras. <br/>
It seems like she just entered a hallway with a red carpet leading to a stage, and the photographers are eagerly taking pictures of her.<br/>
<br/>
She's dressed in a classy beige sequined dress with a scoop neckline, complemented by a lavish gold necklace.<br/>
With her right foot slightly forward, she exudes confidence.<br/>
Her high cheekbones and facial contours are really accentuated, maybe because of her makeup. <br/>
Her striking eyes further emphasize her confident demeanor.<br/>
The surrounding photographers are casually dressed and they hold professional cameras with powerful flashes that highlight her long, wavy blonde hair even more.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Which Flavor?

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows three flavors of soft serve ice cream in three different-sized cups that are lined up.<br/>
Each cup holds a different amount of neatly swirled star-shaped soft serve ice-cream.<br/>
<br/>
On the left, the largest cup features a rich, brown chocolate flavor.<br/>
In the middle-sized cup, there's a delicate, pale pink strawberry flavor, while the smallest cup on the right holds a creamy, off-white vanilla flavor.<br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll break here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video, I talked about three varieties of soft serve ice cream.<br/>
If I had to make a choice based on greed alone, I'd go for the larger portion of chocolate.<br/>
<br/>
However, when it comes to my actual preference, it really depends on my mood. <br/>
During the summer, I often crave something refreshing like mint chocolate or the tang of a Valencia orange flavor. <br/>
But when winter arrives, I tend to stick to the comforting classics like vanilla or chocolate.<br/>
Soft serve is an ideal treat, especially on hot days.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, the background is completely white with no shadows, giving it a staged representation.<br/>
