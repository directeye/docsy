## Exercise 1: Brushing Teeth with Mom

{{<alert>}}
This script is devided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows a young boy brushing his teeth in the bathroom, with his mother holding him. <br/>
The boy, dressed in a blue and white pinstriped short-sleeved shirt, holds a red-orange toothbrush in his right hand, pressing it against his front teeth, and smiling confidently at the camera. <br/>
His mother, in a white blouse, squats beside him on his right, embracing his lower chest and appearing to offer him brushing advice while smiling. <br/>
Upon closer inspection, you can see rings on both of her ring fingers.<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll break here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video, I described the boy and his mother. <br/>
Now, let's take a look at their surroundings. <br/>
In front of them, there appears to be a door with a white and light green striped towel hanging on it. <br/>
Behind them is a sink, with two large mirrors above it, and water running from the faucet. <br/>
It's possible they were originally brushing at the sink behind them, but for the photo, the mother lifted him and moved to the other side, facing the camera for the boy to pose. <br/>
The mirror above the sink is slightly blurry, but it seems to reflect a kids' space with a light green floor.<br/>
