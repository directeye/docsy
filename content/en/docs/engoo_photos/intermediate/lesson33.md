## Exercise 1: Jogging

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
Displayed in the photo is someone by the pool, lacing up their running shoes. <br/>
We can’t see their outfit, but they're probably in lightweight running gear. <br/>
From the shadow, it’s unclear if they’re wearing a cap. <br/>
They have a green smoothie on the ground next to their feet. <br/>
In the background, there are palm trees lining the far side of the outdoor pool. <br/>
It's a nice setting for a run. <br/>
Once they get those laces tied and knock back that smoothie, it looks like they'll be hitting that well-paved, light running trail.<br/>
By the way, whenever I go for a jog myself, I always take my smartphone to use a run-tracking app.<br/>

## Exercise 2: A Cup of Tea

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a woman enjoying tea on a terrace. <br/>
Her long chestnut hair is swept over her right shoulder, and she wears a flowing turquoise dress with matching earrings. <br/>
Cradling a clear glass teacup in both hands, she draws it close, eyes closed as she inhales the aroma of the steaming herbal tea.<br/>
The blurred background makes it unclear if she’s indoors or outdoors, but the absence of a window frame near the railing suggests she’s outside. <br/>
The deep red flowers on the right look like roses. <br/>
The lack of visible ground and the treetops in the distance hint at an upstairs terrace. <br/>
Soft, warm sunlight washes over her, creating a wonderfully relaxing atmosphere for her tea break.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Victory!

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
Displayed in the photo is the moment of a man reveling in victory on the pitch. <br/>
With his team jersey pulled up to cover his face, he triumphantly raises both arms in a power pose.<br/>
He's sliding on his knees to the pristine white lines of the well-manicured field.<br/>
The stadium stands are packed to the third level with ecstatic fans, the air charged with excitement as showers of confetti rain down in a colorful blizzard. <br/>
The stadium lights are on, but the setting sun casts a diagonal beam of light, almost as if honoring the victory. <br/>
This appears to be from a football match, likely at the moment of a decisive goal or a championship win.<br/>
<br/>
I'll stop here for now, as the explanation is quite long.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video, I described the athletes celebrating their victory on the playing field. <br/>
Now, I want to share my thoughts on watching sports.<br/>
<br/>
The truth is, I very rarely attend games in person at the stadium. <br/>
The only time I really get invested is during the World Cup when I'm cheering on the Japanese national team.<br/>
These days, without having a TV, I've become quite disconnected from any kinds of sports news, soccer included. <br/>
Even so, when I'm cheering for the Japanese national team at the World Cup, I feel a connection to the players who grew up in the same country as me.<br/>
I think that connection is what fuels my desire to passionately root for them on that grand stage.<br/>
