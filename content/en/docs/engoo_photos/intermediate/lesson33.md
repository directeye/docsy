## Exercise 1: Jogging

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows someone by a swimming pool who is lacing up their running shoes.<br/>
Their outfit isn't fully visible, and their shadow doesn't indicate whether they're wearing a cap, but they seem to be in lightweight running gear.<br/>
A green smoothie sits on the ground next to their feet. <br/>
In the background, palm trees line the far side of the swimming pool, making the whole area look perfect for running. <br/>
They’ll likely head to the well-paved, light running trail once they've tied their shoelaces and downed their smoothie. <br/>
Even though they don't seem to have any digital devices with them, I always bring my smartphone to use a run-tracking app whenever I go for a jog myself.<br/>

## Exercise 2: A Cup of Tea

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a woman enjoying tea on a terrace. <br/>
Her long chestnut hair is swept over her right shoulder, and she is wearing a sleeveless turquoise top with matching earrings.<br/>
Holding a clear glass teacup in both hands, she draws it close with her eyes closed as she inhales the aroma of the steaming herbal tea.<br/>
The blurred background makes it unclear if she’s indoors or outdoors, but the absence of a window frame near the railing suggests she’s outside. <br/>
The deep red flowers on the right look like roses. <br/>
The lack of visible ground and the treetops in the distance hint at an upstairs terrace. <br/>
Soft, warm sunlight washes over her, creating a wonderfully relaxing atmosphere for her tea break.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Victory!

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows a professional soccer player celebrating a victory on the pitch.<br/>
With his team jersey pulled up over his head to cover his face, he triumphantly punches the air with both arms, while sliding on his knees towards the white line of the well-manicured field. <br/>
The stadium stands are completely packed with ecstatic fans, the air charged with excitement as showers of confetti rain down in a colorful blizzard.<br/>
The stadium lights are on, but the setting sun casts a diagonal beam of light, almost as if honoring the victory. <br/>
This appears to be taken during a football match, likely at the moment of a decisive goal or a championship win.<br/>
<br/>
I'll stop here for now, as the explanation is quite long.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video, I described the athlete celebrating his victory on the playing field. <br/>
Now, I want to share my thoughts on watching sports.<br/>
<br/>
The truth is, I almost never attend games in person in a stadium. <br/>
The only time I really get interested is during the World Cup when I'm cheering on the Japanese national team.<br/>
These days, without having a TV, I've become quite disconnected from any kind of sports news, soccer included. <br/>
Even so, when I'm cheering for the Japanese team at the World Cup, I feel a connection to the players who grew up in the same country as me.<br/>
I think that connection is what fuels my desire to passionately root for them on that grand stage.<br/>
