## Exercise 1: Jogging

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
In the photo, we see someone by the pool, lacing up their running shoes. <br/>
We can’t see their outfit, but they're probably in lightweight running gear. <br/>
From the shadow, it’s unclear if they’re wearing a hat. <br/>
They have a green smoothie on the ground next to their feet. <br/>
In the background, there are palm trees lining the far side of the outdoor pool. <br/>
It's a nice setting for a run. <br/>
Once they get those laces tied and knock back that smoothie, it looks like they'll be hitting that well-paved, soft running trail.<br/>
By the way, whenever I go for a jog myself, I always take my smartphone to use a run-tracking app.<br/>
