## Exercise 1: Jogging

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
In the photo, we see someone by the pool, lacing up their running shoes. <br/>
We can’t see their outfit, but they're probably in lightweight running gear. <br/>
From the shadow, it’s unclear if they’re wearing a hat. <br/>
They have a green smoothie on the ground next to their feet. <br/>
In the background, there are palm trees lining the far side of the outdoor pool. <br/>
It's a nice setting for a run. <br/>
Once they get those laces tied and knock back that smoothie, it looks like they'll be hitting that well-paved, soft running trail.<br/>
By the way, whenever I go for a jog myself, I always take my smartphone to use a run-tracking app.<br/>

## Exercise 2: A Cup of Tea

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a woman enjoying tea on a terrace. 
Her long chestnut hair is swept over her right shoulder, and she wears a flowing turquoise dress with matching earrings. <br/>
Cradling a clear glass teacup in both hands, she draws it close, eyes closed as she inhales the aroma of the steaming herbal tea.<br/>
The blurred background makes it unclear if she’s indoors or outdoors, but the absence of a window frame near the railing suggests she’s outside. <br/>
The deep red flowers on the right look like roses. <br/>
The lack of visible ground and the treetops in the distance hint at an upstairs terrace. <br/>
Soft, warm sunlight washes over her, creating a wonderfully relaxing atmosphere for her tea break.<br/>
