## Exercise 1: A Briefcase

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a messy desk with items from a black briefcase haphazardly scattered across it.  <br/>
<br/>
There's a tablet, a smartphone, headphones, a blue calculator, horn-rimmed glasses that catch your eye right away. <br/>
Among the stationery items, you'll find a pen with its blue cap off, a push-top pen, a capped pink highlighter, yellow sticky notes, a personal organizer with a bookmark string, a spiral-bound notepad, binder clips, paperclips, and a red stapler.<br/>
There are also miscellaneous items like a pair of keys, an orange paper cup with a white lid, a few crumpled pieces of paper, and a black bowtie. <br/>
<br/>
The pair of glasses and gadgets lying unprotected imply disarray, possibly indicating a frantic search for something important, like a wallet.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Learning to Use the Computer

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
In the photo, there's an elderly gentleman with white hair in a pale blue work shirt struggling to learn computer skills. <br/>
He is wearing horn-rimmed glasses designed to block out blue light. <br/>
<br/>
A young woman with blonde hair, dressed in a black one-piece dress and a beige cardigan, is helping him learn about computers. <br/>
She's leaning over his chair from behind, guiding his hands on the laptop keyboard. <br/>
Despite her attentive efforts, he still looks a bit puzzled. <br/>
<br/>
The classroom boasts a clean white aesthetic, from textured walls to a table with a pristine sheen, and a white laptop and coffee mug, which are all likely illuminated by white, fluorescent lights. <br/>
Interestingly, a smartphone and pen rest on the desk, but no paper for notes.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Roast Chicken

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
In the photo, there's a lace tablecloth spread over a shiny cream-colored table. <br/>
On top of it, the centerpiece is a beautifully seared roast turkey adorned with lemon, yellow and red cherry tomatoes, all resting on a bed of lettuce. <br/>
Adjacent to the main dish on the left side of the photo, there's a small plate holding a dessert of pineapple slices and red berries, topped with fruit sauce.<br/>
<br/>
Empty cut crystal wine glasses are thoughtfully placed on the table's right foreground and left background. <br/>
This setup truly captures the essence of a Thanksgiving or Christmas feast.<br/>
