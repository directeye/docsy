## Exercise 1: At the Office

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
Displayed in the photo is an open plan office. <br/>
On the left side in the front and the right side at the back, you've got rows of desks where employees are sitting at their assigned spots. <br/>
The large, front-facing desks are divided by low partitions.<br/>
Every desk has a monitor, and you can see several employees working on laptops while others are using desktop computers. <br/>
Some people's heads are down as they work, while others are on office phones or huddled together, collaborating on something as they look at a monitor. <br/>
You can't see the people sitting behind the partitions in the right row. <br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll pause here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
Looking towards the back rows where employees are seated, you can see some cabinets or storage units, and beyond those, there are open meeting spaces. <br/>
In the far right corner is a glass-enclosed private office, probably for an executive.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, after the COVID pandemic, my company stopped assigning individual desks. <br/>
We transitioned to a touchdown space, where you can sit at any available desk. <br/>
However, in the past four years since COVID, I've only commuted to the office a handful of times. <br/>
I prefer my home office because I can lie down for a guilt-free half-hour nap after lunch, clear my head, and work productively in the afternoon.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Healthy Living

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo captures a couple dressed in matching grey T-shirts and shorts, sitting on the sandy beach, ready to enjoy their salad. <br/>
The man is holding a clear plastic salad container in his right hand and a fork in his left, pointing it at the salad while talking to his girlfriend. <br/>
She’s holding her own salad container, and she's literally in the middle of bringing a forkful up to her mouth, whilst smiling in response to whatever he’s saying. <br/>
<br/>
Behind them, the beach slopes up towards some greenery visible at the top.<br/>
In the distance, there's a solitary palm tree behind the man.<br/>
To the right, you can see the gray ocean extending from the beach, meeting the cloudy sky at a hazy horizon.<br/>

## Exercise 3: An Amazing View

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
Captured here is a serene lake surrounded by majestic mountains, along with a terrace that offers a breathtaking vantage point.<br/>
The magnificent snow capped blue mountains and crystal-clear lake set against a blue sky with drifting white clouds look like a painting.<br/>
The water extends under the terrace, making it appear as if the terrace is floating on the lake. <br/>
The terrace is enclosed by transparent acrylic railings, providing an unobstructed view of the water below. <br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll pause here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
Now, let's turn our attention to the details of the terrace itself. <br/>
Underfoot, wooden tiles cover the floor, complementing the modern L-shaped wicker-framed sofa and matching low table that furnish the terrace. <br/>
A green living wall provides a natural backdrop behind the sofa.<br/>
Whether this well-manicured terrace is on a cruise boat or overlooking a lakeside resort is unclear, but the seamless integration of natural materials cultivates an atmosphere of tranquility and inviting comfort. <br/>
Incidentally, one can't help but wonder how the fluffy cushions adorning the sofa's corners, and the sofa itself, are protected from the elements when the weather turns inclement.<br/>
Regardless, it's definitely a place worth visiting to experience the coolness of early summer.<br/>
