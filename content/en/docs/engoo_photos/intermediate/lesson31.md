## Exercise 1: At the Office

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows an open office layout. <br/>
On the left side in the front and the right side in the back, you've got rows of desks where employees are sitting at their assigned spots. <br/>
The large, face-to-face tables are divided by low partitions.<br/>
Every desk has a monitor, and you can see some folks working on laptops while others are using desktop computers. <br/>
Some people are heads-down, working quietly, while others are on office phones or huddled together, collaborating on something as they look at a monitor. <br/>
You can't see the people sitting behind the partitions on the right row. <br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll pause here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
Looking towards the back of the desk rows where employees are seated, you can see some cabinets or storage units, and beyond those, there are open meeting spaces. <br/>
In the far right corner, there’s a glass-enclosed private room, probably for someone higher up or a team leader.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, after the COVID pandemic, my company stopped assigning individual desks. <br/>
We transitioned to a free-address seating system, where you can sit at any available desk. <br/>
However, in the past four years since COVID, I've only commuted to the office a handful of times. <br/>
I prefer my home office because I can take a guilt-free half-hour nap after lunch, clear my head, and work productively in the afternoon.<br/>
