## Exercise 1: It's Time for an Adventure

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photograph shows a woman enjoying a sweeping, green landscape from a scenic viewpoint. <br/>
Her long black hair flows behind her as she stands with her arms outstretche, seeming to savor the vast expanse of nature before her.<br/>
The scenery is filled with lush, green forest stretching as far as the eye can see. <br/>
In the distance, a large mountain looms, its slopes similarly covered with thick vegetation.<br/>
Although the sky is overcast, it doesn't seem gloomy, hinting at ideal weather for a hike. <br/>
She’s dressed in a light jacket and beige pants, with a moderately full backpack on her shoulders, likely packed with hiking essentials. <br/>
After climbing from the base of the mountain, she’s probably feeling a sense of accomplishment as she gazes out at this breathtaking view.<br/>
