## Exercise 1: Training

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a scene in a fitness gym where a trainer is helping with strength training using dumbbells.<br/>
A woman in white sleeveless top and red shorts lies on an inclined bench with her long hair tied up, arms extended upward holding dumbbells.<br/>
A man in a gray T-shirt and black leggings with a green stripe stands behind the bench, supporting her wrists.<br/>
Treadmills are visible by windows in the clean, bright gym.<br/>
I'd like to go to the gym to get more exercise, but I'm hesitant because my belly is sticking out and my body is so out of shape. <br/>
I feel like I'm not in good enough condition to even go to a gym in the first place.<br/>
