## Exercise 1: Training

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows a scene in a fitness gym where a trainer is helping with strength training using a dumbbell.<br/>
The woman is wearing a white sleeveless shirt and red shorts, with her long hair tied up on top of her head. <br/>
She's lying on an inclined workout bench and is holding the dumbbell with both hands, extending her arms vertically above her chest.<br/>
A man in a gray T-shirt and black leggings with a green stripe stands beside her, helping guide the weight.<br/>
The woman appears focused on her workout, and the man seems to be providing support to ensure she performs the movement correctly.<br/>
<br/>
I'll stop here, as the explanation is quite long.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video I described a scene in a gym where a man is assisting a woman with her workout.<br/>
Now, let's take a look at the surroundings.<br/>
The gym is equipped with various exercise machines including treadmills by the windows in the background, and the environment is clean and well-lit. <br/>
<br/>
Personally, I've been considering joining a gym to improve my fitness, but I'm hesitant because my belly is sticking out and my body is so out of shape.<br/>
With so many people at the gym who are serious about their fitness, I sometimes feel like my goals are too modest, which makes me uncomfortable.<br/>
