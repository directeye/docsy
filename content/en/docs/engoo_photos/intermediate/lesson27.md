## Exercise 1: Surprise!

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
In the photo, there's a guy with short hair, wearing a blue T-shirt and some stubble. <br/>
He's standing just behind his girlfriend to the right, his left hand covering her eyes. <br/>
In his right hand, he's holding a pale pink gift box with a white ribbon, which he's extending in front of her. <br/>
He's smiling and seems to be whispering something to her.<br/>
<br/>
His girlfriend, a long-haired blonde woman, is wearing a white and pale light blue checkered jacket. <br/>
She's sitting with her hands together, slightly tilted to the right, smiling eagerly. <br/>
She doesn't know what's inside the box, but if she opens it, she might find a real jack-in-the-box, which would surprise her even more.<br/>

## Exercise 2: At the Movies

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo captures an audience watching a movie in a theater. <br/>
The theater looks relatively empty, with people sitting in the middle of two central rows that have a good view of the screen. <br/>
In the front row, five people are sitting alternately, men and women, with no empty seats between them. <br/>
It seems like three people are sitting together in the front, and a couple is sitting beside them. <br/>
In the back row, two people are sitting with one seat empty between them.<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll break here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video, I described how the audience was seated in the movie theater. <br/>
Now, let's talk about their behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Up front, there are two women holding popcorn boxes, while the man between them is sipping from a regular-sized paper cup. <br/>
Beside them, a couple is leaning forward, completely engrossed in the movie, while two individuals sitting alone in the back row is watching with good posture.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, when I'm at the movies, I'm often influenced by the people around me. <br/>
If someone nearby is munching on popcorn or taking a sip from their drink, I might feel tempted to do the same. <br/>
And if I notice others getting up to go to the restroom, it often triggers the urge for me as well.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Active in Class

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
In the photo, it's a classroom scene during a lesson. <br/>
Towards the center at the back, the teacher appears slightly blurred. <br/>
She seem to be extending her right hand towards the students, likely indicating a question or instruction with her index finger raised.<br/>
Meanwhile, all the students are raising their hands with their index fingers up.<br/>
<br/>
In the background, the blackboard shows erased sections with traces of chalk remaining. <br/>
Below the blackboard, white chalk can be seen placed on the rail. <br/>
A large world map and some informational boards are displayed on both sides of the blackboard.<br/>
Taking a closer look, you can see the teacher's desk and chair to the right of the teacher.<br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll pause here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video I described the classroom setup and what's around the teacher.<br/>
Now, let's focus on the student side in the photo.<br/>
<br/>
The students, dressed in civvies, have colorful pencil cases and notebooks that are left open on their desks.<br/>
Their desks are arranged in a straight line, one beside the other. <br/>
You can notice there's an empty space in front of the teacher's desk where no student desks are placed.<br/>
<br/>
The atmosphere is lively, with all the students eagerly raising their hands, indicating active participation.<br/>
It could be a day designated for parent observation, with guardians observing from the back, or perhaps the class is being recorded, encouraging the students to be particularly enthusiastic. <br/>
