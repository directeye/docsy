## Exercise 1: Surprise!

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo captures a man blindfolding his girlfriend and about to give her a gift. <br/>
The short-haired man, wearing a blue T-shirt and sporting some stubble, stands just behind her to the right. <br/>
He’s covering her eyes with his left hand while holding a pale pink gift box with a white ribbon in his right hand, extending it in front of her. <br/>
He’s smiling and seems to be whispering something to her.<br/>
<br/>
The long-haired blonde woman, wearing a white and light blue checkered jacket, sits with her hands together, tilted to the right, smiling in anticipation. <br/>
She doesn't know what’s inside the box, but if she opens it, she might find a real jack-in-the-box, which would surprise her even more.<br/>
