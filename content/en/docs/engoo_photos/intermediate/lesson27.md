## Exercise 1: Surprise!

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
In the photo, there's a guy with short hair, wearing a blue T-shirt and sporting some stubble.<br/>
He's standing just behind his girlfriend to the right and his left hand covering her eyes.<br/>
In his right hand, he's holding a pale pink gift box with a white ribbon, which he's extending in front of her. <br/>
He's smiling and seems to be whispering something to her.<br/>
<br/>
His girlfriend, a long-haired blonde woman, is wearing a white and pale blue checkered jacket.<br/>
She's sitting with her palms pressed together and slightly tilted to the right as she is smiling eagerly. <br/>
She doesn't know what's inside the box, but if she opens it, she might find a real jack-in-the-box, which would surprise her even more.<br/>

## Exercise 2: At the Movies

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo captures an audience watching a movie in a theater. <br/>
The theater looks relatively empty, with people sitting in the middle of two central rows that have a good view of the screen. <br/>
In the front row, five people are sitting, alternating between men and women, with no gaps between them.<br/> 
It seems like the three people who are in the foreground are sitting together, and a couple is sitting beside them.<br/>
Two people are sitting behind them in the back row with one empty seat between them.<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll break here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video, I described how the audience was seated in the movie theater. <br/>
Now, let's talk about their behavior.<br/>
<br/>
In the first row there are two women holding popcorn boxes, with a man between them sipping from a paper cup.<br/>
The couple that is seated beside them is leaning forward, completely engrossed in the movie.<br/>
Meanwhile, the two individuals sitting alone in the back row are watching seated straight up.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I'm often influenced by those around me in the theater.<br/>
If someone nearby is munching on popcorn or sipping their drink, I might feel tempted to do the same. <br/>
Similarly, if I notice others getting up to go to the restroom, it often triggers the urge for me as well.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Active in Class

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
In the photo, there's an elementary school classroom during a lesson.<br/>
All the students have their hands raised with their index fingers up, eager to answer a question. <br/>
The teacher, slightly blurry but standing towards the center in the front, is extending her right hand, probably choosing which student will answer.<br/>
<br/>
In the background, the blackboard shows erased sections with traces of chalk remaining. <br/>
Below the blackboard, white pieces of chalk can be seen placed on the rail.<br/>
A large world map and some informational boards are displayed on both sides of the blackboard.<br/>
Taking a closer look, you can see the teacher's desk and chair to the right of the teacher.<br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll pause here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video I described the classroom setup and what's around the teacher.<br/>
Now, let's focus on the students in the photo.<br/>
<br/>
The students are dressed casually and have colorful pencil cases and open notebooks on their desks.<br/>
Their desks are arranged in a straight line, one beside the other. <br/>
You can notice there's an empty space in front of the teacher's desk where no desks are placed.<br/>
<br/>
The atmosphere is lively, with all the students actively participating. <br/>
This could be a special day for parent observation, with guardians watching from the back, or maybe the class is being recorded, encouraging the students to be particularly enthusiastic. <br/>
