## Exercise 1: An Unusual Wedding Day

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows a bride and groom on a bicycle rushing to their wedding reception. <br/>
The groom, dressed in a white shirt, a blue suit, and a matching tie, leans forward as he pedals. <br/>
The grassy lawn appears to pose a challenge for the groom to pedal smoothly.<br/>
Meanwhile, the bride, dressed in a pristine white wedding dress and a veil that is held in place by a tiara, helps by pushing from behind. <br/>
The front basket holds a bouquet, ready for the toss later.<br/>
In the background, there seems to be a cabin with wooden planks for siding and a cute little fir tree planted outside. <br/>
The newlyweds to be, probably used this cabin to get ready for the ceremony.<br/>
<br/>
Since the explanation is long, I'll pause here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In my last video, I talked about a bride and groom on a bicycle rushing to their wedding reception.<br/>
Now, let me add my observations.<br/>
<br/>
They might not make it on time, and they may become sweaty or tear their clothes on the bicycle's rough journey. <br/>
Looking at this photo we can't help but feel concerned for them. <br/>
Though they may not seem to be having a smooth start, going through difficulties such as this could be a valuable experience for the hopeful couple or at least an amusing anecdote.<br/>
<br/>
Alternatively, the bicycle might be too small to fit both of them, suggesting the photo is actually part of a wedding photoshoot.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Family

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a mother with a radiant smile as her husband and daughter kiss her on either cheek. <br/>
The mother is sitting on a sofa, holding a bunch of purple flowers on her lap, with her legs crossed. <br/>
The daughter is beside her mother on the sofa, leaning forward to kiss her mother's right cheek. <br/>
Meanwhile, the father is leaning over the back of the sofa to plant a kiss on the other side of her face. <br/>
It could be her birthday or Mother's Day.<br/>
The tidy kitchen counter in the background suggests they might be preparing for a family outing to eat dinner soon.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Funny Feet

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo captures a sweet scene of a little kid lounging in a grassy field.<br/>
They're wearing shorts, letting their bare feet bask in the gentle sunlight. <br/>
The background is softly blurred, but there appears to be a pond or similar body of water reflecting bright light, which adds a lovely glow to the surroundings.<br/>
Adorable green and yellow smiley faces are painted on the soles of their feet and the undersides of their toes are alternately painted green and yellow as well.<br/>
It must have been really ticklish for the kid to have smiley faces painted on the soles of their feet, but they were drawn so neatly without any mess.<br/>
This makes me think that the child must be very patient.<br/>
