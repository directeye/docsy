## Exercise 1: An Usual Wedding Day

{{% pageinfo %}}
This script is devided into two parts.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows a bride and groom on a bicycle rushing to their wedding reception. <br/>
The groom, dressed in a white shirt, a blue suit, and a matching tie, leans forward as he pedals the bicycle. <br/>
The lawn appears to pose a challenge for the groom to pedal smoothly.<br/>
Meanwhile, the bride, dressed in a pristine white wedding dress and a veil that is held in place by a tiara, helps by pushing from behind.<br/> 
The front basket holds a bouquet for the toss.<br/>
The background reveals a quaint log cabin with a cute small fir tree planted outside, suggesting that perhaps they were getting ready there.<br/> 
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I will break here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In my last video, I talked about a bride and groom on a bicycle rushing to their wedding reception.<br/>
Now, let me add my observations.<br/>
<br/>
They might not make it on time, and they may become sweaty or tear their clothes on the bicycle's rough journey. <br/>
Looking at this photo we can't help but feel concerned for them. <br/>
Though they may not seem to be having a smooth start, going through difficulties such as this, could be a valuable experience for the hopeful couple or at least an amusing anecdote.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Family

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a mother with a radiant smile as her husband and daughter kiss her on either cheek. <br/>
The mother is sitting on a sofa, holding a bunch of purple flowers on her lap, with her legs crossed. <br/>
The daughter is beside her mother on the sofa, leaning forward to kiss her mother's right cheek. <br/>
Meanwhile, the father is leaning over the back of the sofa to plant a kiss on the other side of her face. <br/>
It could be her birthday or Mother's Day.<br/>
The tidy kitchen counter in the background suggests they might be preparing for a family outing to eat dinner soon.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Funny Feet

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a small child wearing shorts, lying down in a grassy field, letting their bare feet bask in the gentle sunlight outside. <br/>
Someone has painted green and yellow smiley faces on the soles of their feet, and has also painted each toe green and yellow alternatively. <br/>
I can imagine that it must have been ticklish while the faces were painted on their soft skin. <br/>
Yet they must have been a very patient child because the faces are neatly drawn without any mess.<br/>
