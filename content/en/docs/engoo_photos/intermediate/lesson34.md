## Exercise 1: Friendly Lunch

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo captures five friends enjoying lunch. <br/>
They are almost done with their food and are taking a few sips from their glasses of water.<br/>
The diced fruit platter in the center of the table still has plenty left, with skewers lazily inserted.<br/>
The man and woman in the center are laughing with big smiles on their faces. <br/>
Particularly, the man, who is wearing a blue and white checkered shirt, is laughing so hard that tears might start rolling.<br/>
Meanwhile the woman with loose Afro curls in a one-shoulder white top is also smiling brightly. <br/>
Her eyes are squinting, showing off her pearly whites.<br/>
<br/>
I'll stop here for now, as the explanation is quite long.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video, I talked about the plates on the table and the laughter of the two people in the center.<br/>
Now, let's focus on the other friends. <br/>
The man with neatly tied back black hair, who is sitting beside the woman with Afro hair, seems to be joining in their laughter.<br/>
Similarly, the long-haired woman at the far right appeared to be caught up in the laughter as well.<br/>
Everyone there looked genuinely joyful.<br/>
Meanwhile, a woman in a black sleeveless top with long hair is standing behind the woman with Afro hair, and is facing away from the group.<br/>
It looks like she might be pushing a cart, suggesting a restaurant setting. <br/>
Her face isn't visible, but she seems more focused on her tasks than their conversation.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Helping the Elderly

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows elderly individuals undergoing walking rehabilitation in a nursing home's ward.<br/>
In the forefront, an elderly man in a pink shirt receives encouragement from a nurse as he practices walking with the aid of a walker.<br/>
Behind them, an elderly couple prepares for post-meal rehab.<br/>
The husband stands beside his wife, holding a meal tray, while his wife rouses herself from her bed. <br/>
Upon rising, she firmly grips a tripod walking cane, carefully placing a glass onto the tray held by him. <br/>
Their physical limitations are surely challenging.<br/>
However, the tender interactions between spouses and the compassionate presence of the staff undoubtedly help ease their difficulties, even just a little bit.<br/>
Witnessing their efforts truly warms my heart. <br/>

## Exercise 3: Chocolate Cake

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a decadent slice of chocolate cake. <br/>
It features layers of cocoa-flavored moist sponge and rich brown mousse, topped with a luscious glaze that drips down the sides. <br/>
Two maraschino cherries with joined stems sit on top, making the perfect garnish. <br/>
The round white plate has a few cocoa beans scattered around, highlighting the deep chocolatey notes. <br/>
In the background, there's a pristine white coffee cup and a neatly folded napkin. <br/>
If I could dig into this sweet, mouthwatering cake, I'd definitely order a piping hot black coffee to balance the sweetness. <br/>
Just looking at this photo makes me crave dessert, even if it might add a few pounds!<br/>
