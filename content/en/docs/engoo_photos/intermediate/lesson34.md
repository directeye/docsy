## Exercise 1: Friendly Lunch

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo captures five friends enjoying lunch, almost done with their food and taking a few sips from their glasses of water. <br/>
The diced fruit platter in the center of the table still has plenty left, with skewers lazily inserted.<br/>
The man and woman in the center are laughing with big smiles on their faces.<br/>
Particularly the man, sporting a blue and white checkered shirt, has his mouth wide open, eyes closed, laughing so hard it looks like tears might start rolling. <br/>
Meanwhile, the woman with tight Afro curls in a one-shoulder pure white top is also smiling brightly, her eyes squinting, showing off her pearly whites.<br/>
<br/>
I'll stop here for now, as the explanation is quite long.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video, I discussed the plates on the table and the laughter of the two people in the center.<br/>
Shifting our focus to the other friends, the man with neatly tied back black hair, next to the woman with Afro hair, and the woman with long hair in a sleeveless top on the far right, seemed to be hanging on to their laughter.<br/>
However everyone there looked genuinely joyful.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, the woman in the black sleeveless top with long hair, standing behind the woman with Afro hair, was facing away, but it seemed like she might be pushing a cart, hinting at a restaurant setting.<br/>
Her face wasn't visible but she might have been attending to her tasks without much attention to the conversation.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Helping the Elderly

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows elderly individuals undergoing walking rehabilitation in a nursing home's ward.<br/>
In the forefront, an elderly man in a pink shirt receives encouragement from a nurse as he practices with a walking aid. <br/>
Behind them, a elderly couple prepares for post-meal rehab.<br/>
The husband stands beside his wife, holding a meal tray, while his wife rouses herself from her bed. <br/>
Upon rising, she firmly grips a tripod walking cane, carefully placing a glass onto the tray held by him. <br/>
Though their physical limitations are undoubtedly challenging, the tender interactions between spouses and the compassionate presence of the staff undoubtedly help ease their difficulties, even just a little bit. <br/>
Witnessing their efforts truly warms my heart. <br/>
