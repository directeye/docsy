## Exercise 1: Friendly Lunch

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo captures five friends enjoying lunch, almost done with their food and taking a few sips from their glasses of water. <br/>
The diced fruit platter in the center of the table still has plenty left, with skewers lazily inserted.<br/>
The man and woman in the center are laughing with big smiles on their faces.<br/>
Particularly the man, sporting a blue and white checkered shirt, has his mouth wide open, eyes closed, laughing so hard it looks like tears might start rolling. <br/>
Meanwhile, the woman with tight Afro curls in a one-shoulder pure white top is also smiling brightly, her eyes squinting, showing off her pearly whites.<br/>
<br/>
I'll stop here for now, as the explanation is quite long.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video, I discussed the plates on the table and the laughter of the two people in the center. <br/>
The man with neatly tied back black hair, next to the woman with Afro hair, and the woman with long hair in a sleeveless top on the far right, seemed to join in the laughter. <br/>
Everyone looked genuinely joyful. <br/>
Incidentally, the woman in the black sleeveless top with long hair, standing behind the woman with Afro hair, was facing away, but it seemed like she might be pushing a cart, hinting at a restaurant setting. <br/>
Her face wasn't visible but might have been attending to her tasks without much attention to the conversation.<br/>
