## Exercise 1: OMG!

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The image shows three colleagues at a wooden desk, intently focused on a laptop with worried expressions. <br/>
The man on the left, in a khaki shirt, covers his mouth in shock, as if he's seen something he shouldn't have. <br/>
To the right, the man in a gray blazer has one hand on his forehead and looks like he can't bear to look at the screen. <br/>
His eyes are closed, and his expression says, "Oh no," as if he's deeply troubled.<br/>
Between them, the woman has one hand on her cheek, her mouth slightly open, and her eyes wide with concern.<br/>
It's unclear whether the laptop is displaying a video or some kind of document, but the atmosphere surrounding the three suggests they're facing some kind of difficulty. <br/>

## Exercise 2: I Don't Want to Hear It! 

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows a young girl dressed up as an office worker, looking quite irritated. <br/>
The setting resembles an old-fashioned office with wooden walls and a matching desk, polished to a glossy finish.<br/>
On the desk, there's this orange typewriter with paper in it and one of those old gray telephones with a cord. <br/>
It's hard to tell if it's a rotary phone or has buttons, but either way, it's definitely one of those analog phones you never see anymore, definitely a vintage item. <br/>
<br/>
I'll stop here, as the explanation is quite long.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
The girl has long black hair in two braids, and she’s wearing large round black glasses. <br/>
Over her white long-sleeved shirt, she has on a black-and-white patterned vest.<br/>
What stands out is that she's got her eyes squeezed shut, and her hands pressed against her ears.<br/>
Alternatively, she might be in the middle of writing and experiencing writer's block. <br/>
Perhaps she's unable to concentrate, distracted by various things, and she just wants to yell, "I've had it!"<br/>
Interestingly, the girl seems too young to be using a phone or typewriter, so this could be a stock photo shoot. <br/>
Either way, it's an engaging nostalgic recreation of a vintage office scene from back in the day.<br/>
