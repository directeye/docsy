## Exercise 1: OMG!

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The image shows three colleagues sitting at a wooden desk, intently focused on a laptop with worried expressions. <br/>
The man on the left, in a light brown shirt, covers his mouth in shock, as if he's seen something he shouldn't have. <br/>
To the right, the man in a gray blazer has one hand on his forehead and looks like he can't bear to look at the screen. <br/>
His eyes are closed, and his expression says, "Oh no!" as if he's deeply troubled.<br/>
Between them, the woman has one hand on her cheek, her mouth slightly open, and her eyes wide with concern.<br/>
It's unclear whether the laptop is displaying a video or some kind of document, but the atmosphere surrounding the three suggests they're facing some kind of difficulty. <br/>

## Exercise 2: I Don't Want to Hear It! 

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows a young girl dressed up as an office worker, looking quite irritated. <br/>
The setting resembles an old-fashioned office with wooden walls and a matching desk, polished to a glossy finish.<br/>
On the desk, there's an orange typewriter with a sheet of paper in it, and an old gray phone. <br/>
It's hard to tell whether it’s a rotary or push-button, but either way, it’s definitely an old wired phone with a coiled cord for the receiver, the kind you hardly see anymore. <br/>
It's quite a vintage piece.<br/>
<br/>
I'll stop here, as the explanation is quite long.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
The girl has long black hair in braids and wears oversized black-rimmed glasses, with thick, straight bangs hanging over the frames. <br/>
Dressed in a white long-sleeved shirt under a black-and-white patterned vest, she stands out with her eyes squeezed shut and hands pressed against her ears. <br/>
It's unclear if the ringing phone or the typewriter's clacking is bothering her, but her expression shows frustration. <br/>
Alternatively, she might be in the middle of writing and experiencing writer's block.<br/>
Perhaps she's unable to concentrate, distracted by various things, and she just wants to yell, "I've had it!"<br/>
Interestingly, she looks too young to use the office equipment, suggesting this is a staged stock photo. <br/>
Regardless, it's a captivating recreation of a classic office scene, evoking nostalgia for a bygone era.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Relaxation

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo captures a peaceful scene of a pussy cat lounging on a windowsill. <br/>
This cat looks like a tabby, with distinctive brown and black striped patterns on its back and head, and noticeable white front paws.<br/>
Its pink paw pads suggest it’s still a little kitten. <br/>
The cat is stretched out, resting its face on its right paw, with its front legs extended. <br/>
Its eyes are half-closed, looking totally relaxed and a bit drowsy in the warm sunlight. <br/>
Positioned closer to the window frame, beyond a sheer off-white lace curtain, the cat is soaking up the sunlight streaming in. <br/>
But if you disturb its peaceful sunbathing, it might get annoyed.<br/>
You could get a sharp glare or even a scratch!<br/>
