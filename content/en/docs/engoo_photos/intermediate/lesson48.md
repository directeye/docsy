## Exercise 1: OMG!

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The image shows three colleagues at a wooden desk, intently focused on a laptop with worried expressions. <br/>
The man on the left, in a khaki shirt, covers his mouth in shock, as if he's seen something he shouldn't have. <br/>
To the right, the man in a gray blazer has one hand on his forehead and looks like he can't bear to look at the screen. <br/>
His eyes are closed, and his expression says, "Oh no," as if he's deeply troubled.<br/>
Between them, the woman has one hand on her cheek, her mouth slightly open, and her eyes wide with concern.<br/>
It's unclear whether the laptop is displaying a video or some kind of document, but the atmosphere surrounding the three suggests they're facing some kind of difficulty. <br/>
