## Exercise 1: Let's Talk

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
In the photo, a man and a woman, both dressed in navy business suits, are talking in front of a glass-walled building while looking at a file.<br/>
The man, sporting stubble, is displaying the file and seems to be explaining something. <br/>
Meanwhile, the woman, with strawberry-blond hair neatly tied up at the back, is holding a tablet in her left hand.<br/>
She appears to be contemplating whether to sign the file with a pen, but it seems that she's still on the fence.<br/>
It's worth noting that this is a staged representation, not a candid moment captured.<br/>
In a genuine photo, their backs would typically be reflected in the glass, but in this one, the front of their bodies is mirrored, creating a symmetrical image.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Amusement Park at Night

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a waterfront amusement park.<br/>
The prominent feature in the foreground is a large Ferris wheel, illuminated in vibrant green. <br/>
The pitch-black sky makes the lights pop and look even more dazzling.<br/>
Along the shore, there are spherical objects made of wire, adorned with white lights, creating a beautiful reflection on the water.<br/>
Behind the Ferris wheel is a large commercial shopping complex, accompanied by a multi-level parking lot on one side and a luminous walkway with atmospheric red lighting on the other.<br/>
The picture was taken from a distance across the bay, and the night setting obscures any visible crowd.<br/>
Perhaps the photo was captured after closing hours, although upon approaching the complex, it may reveal a lively night scene.<br/>

## Exercise 3: In the Living Room

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows a beautifully designed living room, unified in tones of white and grey, with elegant laminated flooring. <br/>
In the center of the room, there is a two-seat sofa with 5 cushions in a variety of patterns.<br/>
They feature unique combinations such as zigzags, stripes, and herringbone.<br/>
In front of the sofa, there's a white rug.<br/>
<br/>
Moving towards the back, on the far-left side, there's a white wooden desk and a matching chair, along with a small potted tree that stands as tall as a person.<br/>
On the desk, you can see three photo frames, a desk lamp, and two books stacked on top of each other.<br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I will break here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video, I described the central area and the space around the desk to the left behind the sofa. <br/>
Now, shifting our focus to the right, there's a white cabinet with three potted plants on it.<br/>
<br/>
Alongside this, you'll notice a standard lamp with a white lampshade, and on the far right, a wooden ornament spelling "HOME". <br/>
Taking a closer look, a clock is fitted into the center of the letter O.<br/>
<br/>
On the back wall, three large picture frames feature a stag with antlers, a colorful palm tree design, and a pale blue leaf pattern from left to right.<br/> 
<br/>
The room gives off a sense of meticulous maintenance, creating an incredibly stylish ambiance but void of life.<br/>
