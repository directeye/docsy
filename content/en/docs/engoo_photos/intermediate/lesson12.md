## Exercise 1: Relaxing in the Evening

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo displays a charming U-shaped cobblestone dining street, designated as pedestrian-only with signs indicating that bicycles are prohibited.<br/>
In the center of the front, a predominantly red-themed café hosts a bustling terrace with all tables occupied, creating a lively ambiance for sundowner enjoyment.<br/> 
The right side of the street is also bustling, with two couples at the front of the street strolling hand in hand.<br/>
Additionally, a crepe store on the right attracts customers waiting for their crepes.<br/>
In contrast, the left side appears quieter, resembling a side street with fewer pedestrians. <br/>
While it's unclear if the restaurant on the left with the black signboard is crowded inside, one outdoor table is occupied by a couple.<br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I will break off here.<br/>

In the previous video, I talked about how the dining street looked in the photo.<br/> 
Now, let's dive into identifying the location in this picture.<br/>
<br/>
The entrance lights of the café and the street lamps suggest a European summer evening around 8 PM, with the late afternoon sun touching the building's rooftop along the bustling street.<br/>
<br/>
I searched for this photo on Google Maps and found it's a street on Montmartre hill in Paris. <br/>
Surprisingly, it's not a cul-de-sac, as there's a pathway leading to a busy road in the direction from where the photo was taken.<br/>
Also, I initially thought it was Switzerland because of the Swiss flag adorning the front of the building, but I was way off. <br/>
It's probably a café renovated from a former consulate office.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Fliying Birds

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
In this photo, we've got a captivating scene with a flock of wild birds soaring high against the backdrop of a slightly hazy blue sky. <br/>
They're on a clear mission, heading towards a warmer place.<br/>
Their flight isn't exactly in perfect formation, but it looks like they're flapping their wings to follow a lead bird. <br/>
You'll notice that some of these wild birds have brown wings, so they might be thrushes. <br/>
Also, the presence of that red-barked, leafless willow tree strongly suggests it's late autumn or possibly even winter.<br/>
<br/>
While I'm quite compelled to root for these migratory birds from a distance, there's always that lingering worry that they might fly directly over me.<br/>
You see, there's the ever-present possibility of bird droppings descending from above.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Doing the Laundry

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
This picture shows a woman hanging her family's laundry in the garden.<br/>
It appears to be partly cloudy, with some sunlight and a gentle breeze, ideal for laundry. <br/>
<br/>
She's using aqua green pegs and a matching washing line, separating white from colored clothes.<br/>
From left to right, there's a long-sleeved V-neck shirt hanging upside down, a crew-neck short-sleeved undershirt, a knee-length fluttery skirt, a sleeveless blouse, and a short-sleeved cotton inner jersey. <br/>
<br/>
She has wavy blonde bobbed hair, wearing a light green top with skinny jeans. <br/>
<br/>
To her left, there's a plastic laundry basket with colored clothing.<br/>
Behind her right foot, there appears to be an empty well. <br/>
With no garden lighting, she'll likely bring in the laundry once it's dry while there's still daylight to avoid tripping near the well-like structure.<br/>
