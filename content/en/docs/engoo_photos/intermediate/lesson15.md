## Exercise 1: Chatting with a Friend

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The picture shows two women having a casual chat on an outdoor terrace.<br/>
They both have long, straight brown hair, fluttering in the breeze and are leaning their right elbows on a stainless steel table. <br/>
The lady in the short-sleeved white lace top is holding a cup near her chin, with an untouched muffin on the table. <br/>
Judging by the shape of the mug that the woman in the light blue sleeveless top has placed on the table, I assume that she might have ordered a coffee or latte.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, what drew my attention is the bearded man dressed in a blue checkered jacket sitting at the table right behind them. <br/>
He seems like he might be eavesdropping on their conversation and finding it enjoyable.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Motorcycles

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows three bikers on two motorcycles touring on a mountain pass.<br/>
The lead motorcycle is ridden by a single person, while the following motorcycle in the foreground carries a couple, with the woman as a passenger tightly holding on to the driver's waist.<br/>
All three of them are wearing helmets and thick leather jackets.<br/>
<br/>
The terrain doesn't make it clear if they're going uphill or downhill, but it's clearly a winding road with a sharp left curve up ahead. <br/>
On the left side of the road, the trees have bare branches, suggesting it's late autumn or winter.<br/>
<br/>
They seem to be on a breakfast run to a cozy mountain cafe, and they might be planning to savor a warm cup of coffee and fancy pastries for breakfast.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Great News!

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
In the photo, we can see a woman standing at the edge of a platform, engrossed in reading a message on her smartphone. <br/>
Her face is adorned with a broad smile, and she clenches her fist in excitement.<br/>
<br/>
Though the background is somewhat blurred, it strongly suggests that this photo was taken on the train station platform. <br/>
This is evident from the presence of a sheltering roof and an electronic information board. <br/>
Additionally, in the middle distance, three passengers seem to be engaged in a conversation while waiting for a train, right by the tracks.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps she chose to stand at the edge of the platform because she wanted to openly express her emotions without being observed by others.<br/>
