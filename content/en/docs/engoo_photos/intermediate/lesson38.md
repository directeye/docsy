## Exercise 1: Baking Cookies

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo captures a lovely moment in a dining room with a little boy and his mother. <br/>
The mother is dressed in a green top with a white apron. <br/>
She is standing at the table rolling the cookie dough and is just about to cut out some star shapes.<br/>
I believe she's clearly prepared because she dusted flour onto the table to prevent the dough from sticking and she has rolled the yellow dough evenly.<br/>
Nearby are her baking tools, including a black-rimmed plate that probably held the flour in it, a little sifter, and the rolling pin she used.<br/>
Thoughtfully, she's placed cut-out cookies and extra cutters out of her curious little helper's reach.<br/>
<br/>
I'll stop here for now, as the explanation is quite long.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video, I described how the mother was preparing to cut out cookies at the dining table. <br/>
Now, let's turn our attention to the boy.<br/>
He's absolutely adorable and is standing on a chair with a cookie cutter in his hand. <br/>
But he is completely captivated by the flour that his mother has dusted on the table, and seems to be making a pattern in it with his finger.<br/>
You can see him tracing it with his finger, clearly fascinated.<br/>
I think the mother intends to let him join in and cut out some cookies soon. <br/>
It’s heartwarming to see them enjoying their time baking together.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Paperwork

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo captures a woman in the kitchen, clearly stressed over paperwork. <br/>
She’s probably redoing expense reports or balancing the household budget. <br/>
She’s comparing receipts with a printed expense report on the table, but the numbers aren't adding up. <br/>
With her right hand on her forehead, she’s pushing her hair back, frowning in frustration. <br/>
She's taken off her glasses and placed them on the table, trying to figure out why the numbers aren't matching, but she seems completely stumped. <br/>
She’s probably checking online bank statements and credit card transactions on her laptop and smartphone, but even that isn't helping her remember. <br/>
<br/>
I'll stop here for now, as the explanation is quite long.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In our previous video, I discussed a woman who was having difficulty with some accounting work.<br/>
Now, let's add my observations.<br/>
<br/>
Given her apparent state of frustration and considering she's already in the comfort of her kitchen, it might be beneficial for her to consider taking a short break. <br/>
She could refresh herself with a glass of water, have a snack, or do something unrelated to clear her mind.<br/>
Even a nap might be beneficial.<br/>
<br/>
Generally, in a world where digital transactions are prevalent, it's crucial to promptly record cash transactions. <br/>
If not noted immediately or by the end of the day, they can be forgotten, leading to discrepancies in financial records. <br/>
This is an aspect of personal finance that merits careful attention.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Take a Bite!

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
In this charming photo, a young girl with braided pigtails is about to take a bite of pizza, her face full of anticipation. <br/>
The pizza looks quite appetizing. <br/>
It's generously covered with cheese and includes toppings like mushrooms and tomatoes.<br/>
She's wearing a long-sleeved shirt with red and white stripes, layered under a short-sleeved navy blue top. <br/>
The combination is pleasantly reminiscent of the American flag.<br/>
One can imagine that when she bites into the pizza, the cheese might stretch a bit, which could make eating it a tad challenging. <br/>
However, that's often part of the enjoyment of a good slice of pizza.<br/>
The photo beautifully captures a moment of simple pleasure.<br/>
