## Exercise 1: Baking Cookies

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo captures a lovely moment in the dining room with a little boy and his mother. <br/>
The mother is dressed in a green top with a white apron, standing at the table rolling out cookie dough.<br/>
She's just about to cut out some star shapes.<br/>
<br/>
She's clearly prepared, dusting flour onto the table to prevent the dough from sticking to it, and rolling the yellow dough evenly. <br/>
Nearby are her baking tools, including a black-rimmed plate that probably held the flour in it, a little sifter, and the rolling pin she used.<br/>
Thoughtfully, she's placed cut-out cookies and extra cutters out of her curious little helper's reach.<br/>
<br/>
I'll stop here for now, as the explanation is quite long.<br/>

In the previous video, I described how the mother was preparing to cut out cookies at the dining table. <br/>
Now, let's turn our attention to the boy.<br/>
He's absolutely adorable, standing on a chair with a cookie cutter in hand, but he is completely captivated by the edge of the flour on the table. <br/>
You can see him tracing it with his finger, clearly fascinated.<br/>
I think the mother intends to let him join in and cut out some cookies soon. <br/>
It’s heartwarming to see them enjoying their time baking together.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Paperwork

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo captures a woman in the kitchen, clearly stressed over paperwork. <br/>
She's likely working on expense reports or balancing household accounts, comparing receipts in her hand to a financial statement on the table, but the numbers don't seem to add up. <br/>
She has her right hand on her forehead and brushes her hair back slightly, furrowing her brow in frustration. <br/>
She's taken off her glasses and placed them on the table, trying to figure out why the numbers aren't matching, but she seems completely stumped. <br/>
She’s probably checking online bank statements and credit card transactions on her laptop and smartphone, but even that isn't helping her remember. <br/>
<br/>
I'll stop here for now, as the explanation is quite long.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In our previous video, I discussed a woman who was having difficulty with some accounting work.<br/>
Now, let's add my observations.<br/>
<br/>
Given her apparent state of frustration and considering she's already in the comfort of her home kitchen, it might be beneficial for her to consider taking a short break. <br/>
She could refresh herself with a glass of water, have a snack, or do something unrelated to clear her mind.<br/>
Even a nap might be beneficial.<br/>
<br/>
Generally, in a world where digital transactions are prevalent, it's crucial to promptly record cash transactions. <br/>
If not noted immediately or by the end of the day, they can be forgotten, leading to discrepancies in financial records. <br/>
This is an aspect of personal finance that merits careful attention.<br/>
