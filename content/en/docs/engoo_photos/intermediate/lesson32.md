## Exercise 1: Drowning in Money

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The picture shows a man getting a large amount of money.<br/>
It's a clearly staged image, but dollar notes are falling from above, suggesting he’s had some business success. <br/>
The man is wearing a gray suit, a light blue shirt, and a striped tie. <br/>
With both hands raised in a victorious gesture and his mouth open in an exuberant shout, he looks like he’s reveling in his hard-earned triumph. <br/>
The man in the photo exudes ambition and energy. <br/>
For someone like me, now well into the latter half of life and living an ordinary existence, I've lost that hunger to strike it big in one shot. <br/>
Yet, even to me, his display of achievement is dazzling.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Friends at the Beach

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
It captures the exhilarating moment when five girlfriends jump towards the ocean in unison. <br/>
They're all sporting bikini tops and denim shorts, arms flung up as they bend their knees and launch themselves high off the sandy beach, kicking up sprays of sand.<br/>
All five have long hair and are about the same height, with the woman in the center having beautiful blonde hair. <br/>
A turquoise blue ocean stretches endlessly under a brilliantly clear sky, with not a single cloud in sight, offering a crisp view all the way to the horizon.<br/>
The five friends are probably letting out joyful shouts as they jump, even though we can't see their expressions from this angle. <br/>

## Exercise 3: Milk

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a milk bottle with a white cap on top, a white mug with a black rim filled with milk, and a blue and white checkered handkerchief, all placed on a white wooden slatted table.<br/>
The milk bottle isn't completely full, so it looks like some of the milk has been poured into the mug.<br/>
The round bottle is lying on its side, but the slightly crumpled handkerchief casually placed next to it is acting as a stopper, keeping the bottle from rolling away.<br/>
By the way, I can’t help but wonder about the black circular ring on the table in the foreground. <br/>
I’m not sure what could have caused that mark.<br/>
