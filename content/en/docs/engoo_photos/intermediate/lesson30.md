## Exercise 1: City Beach

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows a bustling beach adjacent to an urban area, with crowds of people enjoying swimming and sunbathing on what seems to be a sunny summer weekend.<br/>
Although the beach appears man-made, the stretch of white sand and crystal-clear turquoise waters look incredibly inviting for taking a dip in swimsuits.<br/>
In the foreground, the shadows cast by palm trees provide shady respite where some beachgoers are lounging comfortably.<br/>
Taking a closer look, you'll notice a lifeguard stationed in a watchtower across the shore, with beach parasols scattered around.<br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll pause here.<br/>

Looking at the surroundings, you’ll see that this beach park is surrounded by trees, likely acting as a barrier to prevent sand from blowing out. <br/>
Just beyond the tree line, the downtown skyline’s high-rises come into view.<br/>
A gleaming glass skyscraper at the forefront stands out, probably offering panoramic beach views from its upper floors, possibly housing a pricey hotel.<br/>
Given it’s the weekend, the business district is likely quieter compared to the lively beach scene.<br/>
Incidentally, when I ran this image through Google Lens, it pinpointed this location as Street Beach in Brisbane.<br/>
It looks like an ideal spot to spend a weekend, close to both the city center and the picturesque waterfront.<br/>
