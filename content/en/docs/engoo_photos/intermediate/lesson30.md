## Exercise 1: City Beach

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows a bustling beach adjacent to an urban area, with crowds of people enjoying swimming and sunbathing on what seems to be a sunny summer weekend.<br/>
Although the beach appears man-made, the stretch of pristine white sand and crystal-clear turquoise waters look incredibly inviting for taking a swim.<br/>

In the foreground, the shadows cast by palm trees provide shady respite where some beachgoers are lounging comfortably on picnic sheets.<br/>
Taking a closer look, you'll notice a lifeguard stationed in a watchtower across the shore, with beach umbrellas scattered around.<br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll pause here.<br/>

Looking at the surroundings, you’ll see that this beach area is surrounded by trees, likely acting as a barrier to prevent sand from blowing out. <br/>
Just beyond the tree line, the downtown skyline’s high-rises come into view.<br/>
A gleaming glass skyscraper at the forefront stands out, probably offering panoramic beach views from its upper floors, possibly housing a pricey hotel.<br/>
Given it’s the weekend, the business district is likely quieter compared to the lively beach scene.<br/>
Incidentally, when I ran this image through Google Lens, it pinpointed this location as Street Beach in Brisbane.<br/>
It looks like an ideal spot to spend a weekend, close to both the city center and the picturesque waterfront.<br/>

## Exercise 2: City Skyline at Dusk

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo captures dusk as the downtown high-rise district begins to light up.<br/>
Despite clouds obscuring the sunset, glimpses of the bluish-white twilight sky peek through.<br/>
As darkness sets in, the illuminated skyline becomes clear. <br/>
The dark area in the middle, framed by the skyscrapers and a forefront street, looks like a park surrounded by greenery.<br/>
The vividly glowing orange and greenish-white streaks on the major street in the foreground are likely from the strobing streetlights and passing car headlights.<br/>
With only an old iPhone camera, capturing such a crisp low-light photo seems impossible.<br/>
Living in the countryside, opportunities to photograph skyscrapers are rare.<br/>
I wish I could experience taking a photo like this at least once with a professional DSLR camera.<br/>
