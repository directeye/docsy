## Exercise 1: City Beach

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows a bustling beach adjacent to an urban area, with crowds of people enjoying swimming and sunbathing on what seems to be a sunny summer weekend.<br/>
Although the beach appears man-made, the stretch of pristine white sand and crystal-clear turquoise waters look incredibly inviting for taking a swim.<br/>

In the foreground, the shadows cast by palm trees provide shady respite where some beachgoers are lounging comfortably on picnic mats.<br/>
Taking a closer look, you'll notice a lifeguard stationed in a watchtower across the shore, with beach umbrellas scattered around.<br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll pause here.<br/>

Looking at the surroundings, you’ll see that this beach area is surrounded by trees, likely acting as a barrier to prevent sand from blowing away. <br/>
Just beyond the tree line, the downtown skyline’s high-rises come into view.<br/>
A gleaming glass skyscraper at the forefront stands out, probably offering panoramic beach views from its upper floors, possibly housing a pricey hotel.<br/>
Given it’s the weekend, the business district is likely quieter compared to the lively beach scene.<br/>
Incidentally, when I ran this image through Google Lens, it pinpointed this location as Street Beach in Brisbane, Australia.<br/>
It looks like an ideal spot to spend a weekend, close to both the city center and the picturesque waterfront.<br/>

## Exercise 2: City Skyline at Dusk

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo captures dusk as downtown high-rises light up. <br/>
Despite clouds obscuring the sunset, glimpses of the bluish-white twilight sky peek through. <br/>
As darkness falls, the illuminated skyline stands out vividly. <br/>
In the center, a dark patch framed by skyscrapers and a street appears to be a park surrounded by greenery.<br/>
Once crowded, the park now lies cloaked in darkness and stillness, without streetlamps. <br/>
The glowing orange and greenish-white streaks on the main road are likely from streetlights and the headlights of passing cars. <br/>
Capturing such a crisp low-light shot with an old iPhone seems unlikely. <br/>
Living in the countryside, I rarely get to photograph city skylines, but a professional DSLR would let me capture an urban twilight scene like this at least once.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Fireworks Display

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
This photo captures a dazzling fireworks display lighting up a pitch black sky over a waterfront in vivid colors.<br/> 
On either side of the photo, fireworks shoot upwards, leaving trails behind, accompanied by small orange scale-like sparklers bursting outward from their trajectories.<br/>
As they reach higher, some vibrant pink spherical fireworks appear, overlapping to create an even brighter spectacle.<br/>
At the center's highest point, a massive purple firework with a glowing red core dances gracefully through the air.<br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll pause here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
Shifting our focus to the bottom right corner, neon lights softly illuminate what appears to be the stadium entrance. <br/>
Upon closer inspection, it's evident that the stadium field serves as the launch pad for the pink fireworks, with the venue's light poles turned off. <br/>
Along the shore, the sparkling trails of fireworks and neon lights are reflected on the surface of the water.<br/>
<br/>
Culturally, such firework displays are often associated with New Year's celebrations in the West.<br/>
In Japan, they're a staple of the summer Bon festival season, celebrated nationwide. <br/>
Incidentally, the Japanese Bon festival has cultural similarities to Christianity's All Souls' Day, a time to honor ancestral spirits. <br/>
