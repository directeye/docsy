## Exercise 1: Walking the Dog

This script is devided into two parts.

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
In the picture, we see a young couple walking barefoot with their dog along the water's edge, enjoying the relaxed atmosphere.<br/>
The man wears a lightweight, long-sleeved white shirt and mint green shorts, while the woman sports a navy blue and white checkered crop top with ripped jeans that end just below the knee.<br/>
Their white dog walks alongside the woman on a red leash that she's holding in her right hand.<br/>
In the background, we can see a tranquil, deep blue sea and the uninterrupted horizon against a light blue, cloudless sky.<br/>
No swimmers grace the water, and the pristine beach bears no footprints.<br/>
<br/>
This explanation will be long, so I'll pause here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In my previous video, I described a young couple and their dog taking a walk by the seaside.<br/>
Now, let me continue my thoughts on this delightful scene.<br/>
<br/>
They appear to be walking shortly after sunrise, bathed in the bright sunlight from above the horizon.<br/>
The early hour, relaxed attire and the company of their dog suggest that they may live nearby.<br/>
They seem to be relishing what looks like a private beach, free from other beachgoers, with a splendid view of the sea and gentle sea breeze.<br/>
It's truly enviable. <br/>
Personally, I love both the deep blue sea and the turquoise waters of tropical coral reefs equally. <br/>
However, considering Japan's earthquake and tsunami risks, living by the beach makes me apprehensive.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Busy at Work

This script is devided into two parts.

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The picture shows a man in a white shirt and black tie, sitting at a large wooden table. <br/>
With a serious expression, he is taking notes on a notepad attached to a clipboard. <br/>
He's got a wristwatch on his left arm.<br/>
The table is somewhat messy with a stapler, utility knife, ruler, pen, calculator, and crumpled papers scattered around. <br/>
In the front left of the picture, there's a black coffee cup resting on a saucer. <br/>
On the right, there's a potted plant in a square clay pot. <br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll pause here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In my last video, I talked about a man taking notes and the state of his desk. <br/>
Now, let me add my observations.<br/>
<br/>
Firstly, the potted plant might be artificial. <br/>
The man looks tense, he's repeatedly scribbling on a notepad, crumpling papers, and tossing them aside instead of throwing them away. <br/>
He's also pushed his coffee away from him, suggesting he might be putting work ahead of taking a break. <br/>
The coffee may be cold by now too. <br/>
I'd like to encourage him to ease off and unwind, yet it's often tricky to offer advice in these situations. <br/>
People often not be very receptive when stressed. <br/>
I would probably be somewhat hesitant to approach him and suggest taking a breather.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Fresh Tomatoes

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
In the picture there are four cherry tomatoes resting on a wooden cutting board. <br/>
They have green stems, and their red skins glisten with water droplets.<br/>
They seem juicy and fresh in appearance, especially with the perfect play of light. <br/>
After sprinkling a pinch of salt and taking a bite, you'll find they're perfectly ripe and wonderfully sweet. <br/>
The amount seems just right to satisfy as a snack, but it would be healthier to eat them as a salad at a mealtime.<br/>
