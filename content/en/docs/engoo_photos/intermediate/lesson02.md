## Exercise 1: Discussing the Details

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
In the photo, a man and a woman are talking in a hallway, possibly after a meeting. <br/>
The woman, who appears to have some questions, is asking the man for clarification.<br/>
The man in a gray jacket has short hair and stubble on his chin and upper lip. <br/>
He is politely explaining while showing her something in a file.<br/>
The woman, with long hair, is attentively listening, her arms crossed and right hand lightly resting on her chin. <br/>
However, she still appears puzzled.<br/>
Incidentally, the trees dimly visible through the window have turned yellow, indicating that autumn is in full swing.<br/>

## Exercise 2: A Snack

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
In the photo, we can see a plate of rice balls on a large white wooden picnic table.<br/>
The rectangular white ceramic plate, with a fish pattern, holds three triangular rice balls wrapped in crispy seaweed.<br/>
I'm not sure what's inside them, but they look glossy and delicious.<br/>
Since I was feeling a bit hungry, they seem to be a perfect snack to satisfy my appetite.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Skyscrapers

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
This photo shows an impressive view of a group of skyscrapers with fully glass-covered exteriors, taken from a lower angle. <br/>
We can also see that all buildings reflected in the central building of the photo are glass-walled. <br/>
The sky has a good number of clouds, but the sunlight manages to peek through the gaps, creating a nice effect.<br/>
Personally, as someone who lives in the countryside, I don't really have a very positive impression of skyscrapers because they remind me of the hectic commute to the city.<br/>
