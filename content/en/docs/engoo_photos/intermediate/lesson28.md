## Exercise 1: Family

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a parent and baby wild elephant strolling leisurely across a grassy plain. <br/>
The larger one, probably the mother since she doesn’t have tusks, is walking with the baby snugly behind her on the left. <br/>
The mother's lifted left front foot has wet toes, and the baby's trunk, which it’s putting in its mouth, is also wet.<br/>
They might have just come from a watering hole. <br/>
Behind the mother, there’s a sturdy herbivore sitting, though its face isn’t visible. <br/>
At first glance, there don’t seem to be any predators around. <br/>
The grassy plain has lush groves of trees, and it looks like they're enjoying a very peaceful moment.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Couple in the Kitchen

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
In the photo, a young man is making a fresh salad while a young woman gives him advice. <br/>
He’s awkwardly slicing tomatoes with a knife on a cutting board and has also cut cucumbers into thin diagonal slices.<br/>
The woman on the left is resting her right hand on his shoulder, and her red nail polish is quite striking.<br/>
<br/>
On the left side of the cutting board, there's a whole uncut tomato and a half-sliced cucumber. <br/>
From his perspective to the right back side of the cutting board, a clear glass bowl is filled with freshly cut salad. <br/>
To the left back, a measuring scale and a glass of water are placed.<br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll pause here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
Now, shifting our focus to the right of the young couple, a sleek black single sink with a modern faucet stands out. <br/>
Next to it, a knife holder proudly displays three knives. <br/>
At the far end of the L-shaped wooden laminate kitchen counter, a stainless-steel bell-shaped whistling kettle sits atop the stove. <br/>
Above it, a range hood is installed beneath white kitchen cabinets.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing this young couple preparing a fresh salad in their tidy kitchen makes me imagine their joyful new life together. <br/>
It's a heartwarming scene that brings a smile to my face.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Stressed over Work

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The woman in the photo looks worn out, clearly overwhelmed by the work in front of her.<br/>
She's wearing this pale, light blue jacket with long sleeves, and her long hair is brushed back and draped over her left arm. <br/>
On her desk, there's a laptop to the left and a towering stack of thick books and notebooks to the right, almost reaching her shoulder. <br/>
She's trying to type something on the laptop with her right hand, but her hand is just kind of hovering there above the keyboard, paused.<br/>
Meanwhile, her left elbow is propped up on the desk and she's using that hand to cover her face, eyes shut from sheer exhaustion.<br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll pause here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In my previous video, I described the scene of a woman who was exhausted from work.<br/>
Now, let me share my thoughts on this image.<br/>
<br/>
She looks like she could use some help but doesn’t seem to have the energy to contact anyone. <br/>
What she truly needs is to step away from her desk for a while to take a break and recharge herself.<br/>
<br/>
Before the COVID pandemic, I was a workaholic, constantly juggling massive projects that loomed over me. <br/>
But now that I'm working from home full-time and don't have to deal with that daily commute, I've been able to shift my focus to a better work-life balance by tackling projects within my means.<br/>
<br/>
It's really made a positive difference for my wellbeing overall.<br/>
