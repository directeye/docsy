## Exercise 1: Family

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a parent and baby wild elephant strolling leisurely across a grassy plain. <br/>
The larger one is probably the mother since she doesn't have tusks. <br/>
The baby is walking snugly behind her on the left. <br/>
The mother's lifted left front foot has wet toes, and the baby's trunk, which it’s putting in its mouth, is also wet.<br/>
They might have just come from a watering hole. <br/>
Behind the mother, there’s a sturdy herbivore sitting, though its face isn’t visible. <br/>
At first glance, there don’t seem to be any predators around. <br/>
The grassy plain has lush groves of trees, and it looks like they're enjoying a very peaceful moment.<br/>
