## Exercise 1: Pizza Party

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a group of four people, two men and two women, about to enjoy a whole Margherita pizza together. <br/>
It looks like they’re at someone’s home, having just ordered the pizza through a delivery service like Uber Eats, and they’re kicking off a pizza party as it arrives. <br/>
The group is gathered around a counter where the fresh pizza is placed, with one person reaching for a slice while the others watch with smiles. <br/>
In the background, you can see lush potted plants both inside and out on the balcony, adding to the bright and relaxed atmosphere. <br/>
Once the first person grabs a slice, the others are likely to follow, and the conversation will flow as they enjoy their pizza.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Choir

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows a choir practice in a music room.<br/>
On the left side of the image, there's a female choir instructor with long blonde hair, wearing a white long-sleeve shirt. <br/>
She's holding a sheet of music in her left hand and is energetically conducting the children’s choir in front of her with animated gestures.<br/>
The choir consists entirely of girls who are standing in a row, fully focused on singing while holding either a sheet of music or lyrics in their hands. <br/>
Looking closely, you'll notice their mouths moving differently, suggesting they might be performing a mixed-voice choir with sopranos and altos. <br/>
<br/>
I'll stop here, as the explanation is quite long.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video, I talked about the choir practice with the instructor and the girls in the music room.<br/>
Something in the photo really caught my attention, and I’d like to mention it.<br/>
The instructor is paying particular attention to the girls on the right. <br/>
There’s a girl in a green outfit within her line of sight who has her mouth closed, as if she isn’t singing. <br/>
Even though the instructor is concentrating on conducting, she might actually want to say something to the girl.<br/>
In the background, a large arched window lets in bright natural light, enhancing the room’s acoustics. <br/>
It’s likely their harmonized choral performance is resonating beautifully throughout the space.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Pasta Disaster

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a young boy at a kitchen table with a plate of spaghetti in front of him.<br/>
He looks genuinely surprised, with wide eyes and his mouth open. <br/>
What stands out is that the spaghetti noodles are not only on his plate but also draped over his head, almost like he’s wearing a wig made of noodle dreadlocks.<br/>
He’s holding a fork in one hand and a spoon in the other, as if he was just about to start eating.<br/>
Since the spaghetti has no sauce, it’s unlikely this happened while he was actually eating. <br/>
He might have been pranked with a trick that sent the noodles flying onto his head, or the whole scene was set up for a playful photoshoot.<br/>
