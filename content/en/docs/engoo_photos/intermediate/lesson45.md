## Exercise 1: Pizza Party

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a group of four people, two men and two women, about to enjoy a whole Hawaiian pizza together. <br/>
It looks like they’re at someone’s home, having just ordered the pizza through a delivery service like Uber Eats, and they’re kicking off a pizza party as it arrives. <br/>
The group is gathered around a counter where the fresh pizza is placed, with one person reaching for a slice while the others watch and smile. <br/>
In the background, you can see lush potted plants both inside and out on the balcony, adding to the bright and relaxed atmosphere. <br/>
Once the first person grabs a slice, the others are likely to follow, and the conversation will flow as they enjoy their pizza.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Choir

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows a choir practice in a music room. <br/>
On the left side, there's a female choir instructor with long blonde hair, wearing a white long-sleeve shirt. <br/>
She's holding a sheet of music in her left hand and energetically conducting the children's choir using animated gestures. <br/>
The choir, made up entirely of girls, is standing in a row, each holding a sheet of music or lyrics. <br/>
They’re completely focused on singing. <br/>
If you look closely, you can see their mouths moving in different ways, which suggests they might be performing a mixed-voice choir with sopranos and altos. <br/>
<br/>
I'll stop here, as the explanation is quite long.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video, I talked about a choir practice with the instructor and the girls in a music room. <br/>
<br/>
I'd like to mention one thing that caught my attention in that photo.<br/>
Notice the instructor focusing on guiding the girls to her right.<br/>
Specifically, the girl in the green outfit, within the instructor's line of sight, has her mouth closed as if she’s not singing.<br/>
While the instructor seems to prioritize conducting the piece, she also might be showing the girl how to sing properly.<br/>
<br/>
In the background, a large arched window lets in bright natural light, which enhances the room's acoustics.<br/>
The choir's harmonious singing beautifully fills the entire space.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Pasta Disaster

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a young boy at a kitchen table with a plate of spaghetti in front of him.<br/>
He looks genuinely surprised, with his eyes wide open and his mouth agape.<br/>
What stands out is that the spaghetti is not only on his plate but also draped over his head, almost like he’s wearing a wig made of noodle dreadlocks.<br/>
He’s holding a fork in one hand and a spoon in the other, as if he’s about to start eating.<br/>
Interestingly, the spaghetti on his head looks plain and cooked without any sauce, and he doesn't seem to mind whether it's hot or cold. <br/>
So, it doesn't look like this happened while he was actually eating. <br/>
The whole scene must be set up for a playfully staged photoshoot.<br/>
