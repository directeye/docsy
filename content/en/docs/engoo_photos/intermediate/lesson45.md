## Exercise 1: Pizza Party

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a group of four people, both men and women, about to enjoy a pizza together. <br/>
It looks like they’re at someone’s home, having just ordered the pizza through a delivery service like Uber Eats, and they’re kicking off a casual pizza party as it arrives. <br/>
The group is gathered around a counter where the fresh pizza is placed, with one person reaching for a slice while the others watch with smiles. <br/>
In the background, you can see lush potted plants both inside and out on the balcony, adding to the bright and relaxed atmosphere. <br/>
Once the first person grabs a slice, the others will likely follow, and the conversation will flow as they enjoy their pizza.<br/>
