## Exercise 1: Christmas Dinner

{{<alert>}}
This script is devided into three parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo captures three generations of family members seated at a Christmas dinner.<br/>
The grandparents are at the head of the table, and what seems to be their son, his wife, and kids are seated on either side.<br/>
The grandparents are dressed in gray while the dad is wearing a red checkered shirt, and the mom looks lovely in a pure white turtleneck pullover. <br/>
The son has a green collared shirt on, and the daughter is in a cardigan with red dots around the collar. <br/>
Everyone's coordinated in Christmas colors. <br/>
The daughter's red and white striped headband is a charming standout. <br/>
The dad, mom, and son rest their hands on the table, while the daughter hides hers underneath.<br/>
They're eagerly anticipating the start of Christmas dinner.<br/>

Now, let's take a look at the spread on the table for the meal. <br/>
The grandfather carves a small golden turkey, while the grandmother stands beside him serving with a salad spoon from a large white bowl. <br/>
Side dishes have been plated up, and there are Christmas crackers nearby, likely prepared by the grandparents. <br/>
Red wine is in front of the grandparents, champagne for the parents, and the children have orange juice. <br/>
The table features a spread of steamed vegetables like broccoli, carrots, and peas, accompanied by baked potatoes and two and a half loaves of French bread. <br/>
Salt and pepper grinders, along with a gravy boat, complete the setting. <br/>
Pine-decorated candles in front of the mother's plate add a festive touch.<br/>

Finally, moving on to the background and my observations. <br/>
<br/>
To the right of the fireplace towards the back, there's a large Christmas tree decked out with red and gold tinsel garlands and other colorful ornaments. <br/>
On the fireplace, several miniature golden Christmas tree ornaments, red tinsel garlands, and two hanging red stockings are displayed.<br/>
<br/>
I've never been part of such a splendid Christmas celebration. <br/>
It makes me wish I could have experienced this kind of joyful atmosphere or at least savored the delicious dishes when I was younger.<br/>
<br/>
As a side note, looking at the blinds on the window in the far-right corner, it still looks bright outside, suggesting they might have started dinner a bit early.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Business Meeting

{{<alert>}}
This script is devided into three parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
This photo is a snapshot of a typical business meeting back in the days when everyone commuted to the office, even before the COVID pandemic.<br/>
All four individuals in the photo are dressed in black suits. <br/>
At the head of the table sits presumably the boss, with short white hair and a striped tie, holding a white laptop, listening to the explanation from the blond-haired man.<br/>
The blond man has brought printed documents and is explaining a colorful pie chart.<br/>
Although we can't see the expression on the blond man's face, it seems he's gauging the reaction from the man with white hair. <br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
Now, moving on to the right of the photo, a man and a woman are holding pens, looking at their notes. <br/>
The man with dark hair neatly parted to the side appears to be taking the minutes of the meeting in a red-covered notebook for later review.<br/>
Meanwhile, the woman, sporting a tied-back blond bun and a pair of glasses, seems more engaged in checking her planner, casually placing meeting materials in front of her.<br/>
Incidentally, both of them have their shirt collars unbuttoned, suggesting they might not have plans for fieldwork or going outside the office.<br/>

{{<card header="**3rd script**">}}
The empty coffee cup placed on the right side of the table suggests an enthusiastic presentation by the speaker, while the untouched glass of water in front of the woman and the lack of active conversation among participants fail to convey an atmosphere of intense discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays, even if meetings are conducted in person, bringing paper documents is almost uncommon. <br/>
Meeting rooms usually have large screen displays for projecting documents and facilitating discussions. <br/>
Moreover, after COVID, internal project meetings predominantly take place through video conferences, reserving face-to-face interactions within the company for specific scenarios like one-on-one interviews with superiors.<br/>
Nevertheless, in-person meetings are still often necessary when engaging with external parties like clients.<br/>

## Exercise 3: A Stroll in a Kimono

{{<alert>}}
This script is devided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
In the picture, two women are adorned in floral-patterned kimonos, the traditional Japanese attire, gracefully holding red parasols outdoors while sharing whispers and laughter.<br/>
The kimonos showcase long robes with wide sleeves, complemented by a broad belt tied at the back. <br/>
Their red lacquered paper parasols feature intricately woven bamboo sticks. <br/>
<br/>
The woman in the red kimono has neatly gathered twisted braids at the back, adorned with a striking red camellia ornament that adds a touch of glamour. <br/>
As she smiles, her left hand delicately covers her mouth, conveying a sense of modesty. <br/>
In contrast, the woman in the yellow kimono lets her brunette hair flow down her left shoulder.<br/>
The background is blurred, but it suggests that they are standing in a large, manicured garden.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video, I described the attire of the two ladies. <br/>
Now, let's delve into the cultural aspects of wearing kimonos. <br/>
<br/>
Traditionally, mastering the art of elegantly wearing kimonos is a formidable task due to the intricate layering, sometimes taking over an hour. <br/>
In modern Japan, it's common to seek the assistance of specialized dressing salons for such occasions. <br/>
Additionally, due to the high cost of kimonos, individuals rarely have the chance to wear them outside of special events like coming-of-age ceremonies or weddings. <br/>
As a result, these two women are fortunate to experience the unique opportunity of donning kimonos, making this occasion truly exceptional for them.<br/>
