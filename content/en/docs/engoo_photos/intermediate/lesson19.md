## Exercise 1: Dreaming

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
In this picture, a woman in a gray T-shirt and pajama bottoms is peacefully asleep on a bed above a large, fluffy white cloud. <br/>
Her long strawberry-blond hair is draped over the pillow as she lies on her right side. <br/>
The bed is white, has a firm mattress and pillow. <br/>
The bedframe is arched steel at its head and foot.<br/>
As she rests comfortably on her bed in the wide-open blue sky without a blanket, it truly gives the impression of her sleeping on a cloud.<br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll take a break here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In my previous video, I talked about the details shown in the photo. <br/>
Now, let's explore what we can imagine and deduce from this image.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps this picture represents a dream she is having while on a plane. <br/>
Trying to sleep in an aero plane seat is not ideal since it doesn't fully recline. <br/>
It seems she's yearning for relaxation and a comfortable sleep.<br/>
<br/>
But, if she were really in a scenario like the one in the photo, there would be some potential risks.<br/>
First, wearing light sleepwear could put her in danger of getting sunburned from the intense UV rays.  <br/>
Secondly, if she were to wake up and look down from such a great height, she might feel overwhelmed with fear, perhaps even scared to death.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Father's Day

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
In the photo, there are presents on a timber desk that a father received for Father's Day. <br/>
There's a tie, a drawing from his son, a photo strip of a moment with his daughter, and a palm-sized parcel. <br/>
<br/>
The tie, with navy, red, and white stripes, looks like a sweet gift from his wife.<br/>
His son's drawing tells the story of a day they spent driving, having a picnic with their dog, playing soccer, and simply having a blast.<br/>
The photo with his daughter is black and white and was probably taken in a photo booth at a mall or perhaps an arcade.<br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll pause here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In my previous video, I explained the details of the gifts on the desk for Dad. <br/>
Now, let's explore what we can imagine or deduce from these presents.<br/>
<br/>
Looking at both his son's drawing and the photo with his daughter, we can see that the dad has a beard and a receding hairline. <br/>
<br/>
He's got a small package in his hands, wrapped up in brown paper and tied with a butterfly knot. <br/>
Probably wrapped at home, and even though we can't see what's inside, I don't suppose it's jewelry or the like.<br/>
Maybe it's something thoughtful, such as a USB flash drive filled with family photos. <br/>
I believe it’s a heartwarming gift that would make him smile.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Inside a Closet

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows an open closet divided into three partitions. <br/>
Let's take a closer look at each of them.<br/>
<br/>
Starting from the left, the partition is split into upper and lower compartment. <br/>
The upper part holds men's collared shirts, while the lower part neatly organizes men's pants on hangers. <br/>
This section is dedicated to men's clothing.<br/>
<br/>
Moving to the central partition, you'll find women's shirts, blouses, and bottoms hanging on a rail. <br/>
A built-in drawer is situated below, on top of which there's a yellow accessory box along with a folded shirt.<br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll pause here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In my last video, I covered the left and center sections of the closet. <br/>
Now, let's shift our focus to the right partition.<br/>
<br/>
It's divided into two compartments. <br/>
The small upper section holds a thick gray cushion. <br/>
The larger lower part features various items, such as a pink cosmetic case on top of a built-in drawer.<br/>
In the center of the lower section, there's a white cabinet with double doors mounted on the back wall of the closet.<br/>
Two picture frames are displayed atop the cabinet, which when opened, reveals a makeup mirror.<br/>
<br/>
While open closets provide easy access, they tend to collect more dust. <br/>
Personally, I prefer closets with doors to address this concern. <br/>
