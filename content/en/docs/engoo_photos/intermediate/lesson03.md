## Exercise 1: Family Cooking

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
In the photo, a little girl and her mother are in the kitchen, wearing matching emerald green aprons. <br/>
The girl is carefully pouring olive oil into a bowl of salad, while her mother gently touches her head and gives her advice. <br/>
On the counter, there are cucumbers, lettuce, red bell peppers, carrots, and tomatoes, cluttered behind the salad bowl. <br/>
A cutting board, a pepper shaker, and the lid of the olive oil bottle that the girl is holding are conveniently placed within the mother's reach.<br/>
Upon closer inspection, you can notice that the motherâ€™s ring subtly glimmers on her right ring finger.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Flowers

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
In this lovely photo, we can see a pet cat standing at the bathroom doorway on a tiled floor, clutching a bunch of yellow tulips.<br/>
The cat is dressed in a blue and white patterned outfit.<br/>
It has fluffy fur, complemented by black markings around its ears and a pristine white face with long, elegant whiskers.<br/>
But its most striking feature is those mesmerizing black pupils.<br/>
The way the cat looks up with its endearing gaze is incredibly cute and simply brings a warm smile to your face.<br/>
Incidentally, this photo was taken by a woman, and it captured only her bare feet, with red painted toenails, on the wooden laminated floor.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Head Massage

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a beautifully suntanned woman receiving a head massage on an outdoor terrace salon. <br/>
Vaguely visible on her left side is a black tray with massage supplies. <br/>
White and pink plumeria flowers are arranged alternately on a raised slatted wooden floor near her head, with one pink blossom placed just above her right ear. <br/>
She is lying on a brown reed mat, and her head is resting on a rolled-up towel. <br/>
Her eyes are closed, and she appears deeply relaxed, on the verge of drifting off to sleep. <br/>
Soothing music fills the air along with aromatic scents.<br/>
