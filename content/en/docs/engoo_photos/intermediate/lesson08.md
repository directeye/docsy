## Exercise 1: Learning to Ride a Bike

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo captures a joyful moment of a young boy riding his bike, perhaps even for the first time without training wheels. <br/>
As his father eagerly encourages him with open arms, the boy looks ecstatic and is shouting with excitement. <br/>
He doesn't have any elbow or knee pads, but he's wearing a shiny golden helmet for safety. <br/>
The boy looks adorable in a green polo shirt, white shorts, and orange sneakers. <br/>
Meanwhile, the father, dressed in a light blue short-sleeved collared shirt, jeans, and athletic shoes, watches his son proudly. <br/>
The boy's striking mountain bike features an orange frame and matching handlebar grips, white front fork and saddle, black handlebars, brake levers and thick, rugged tires.<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll break here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In my previous video, I described the scene of a son riding his bike while his father watched over him. <br/>
Now, let's take a look at the surroundings. <br/>
The faded white center line of the cycling path guides the boy as he cycles straight ahead, just above it. <br/>
In the distance, the path curves gently to the left around a small grove of trees. <br/>
Upon closer inspection, you can see white buildings across the river, suggesting a residential district. <br/>
The picture is set on a scenic cycling path by a river, surrounded by a magnificent natural mountain range. <br/>
It's a touching scene that reflects the father's pride in his son's growth.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Eating an Ice Cream

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
In this arresting photo, a young woman holds a mixed vanilla-strawberry ice cream in a waffle cone. <br/>
She looks stylish as she strikes a playful pose with a slight lift of her left shoulder. <br/>
Her oversized sunglasses with pink frames and pink-tinged mirrored lenses vividly reflect the scene before her. <br/>
A chunky pink chain necklace and a pink vest add charm to her overall look. <br/>
With her ash-blonde hair, she exudes a saucy aura that complements her pink-loving personality. <br/>
The blurry background suggests hills and fields with sunlight peeking through from behind. <br/>
Incidentally, after taking this picture, she probably intended to enjoy the tempting ice cream before it melted.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Ready for School

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo captures a blue backpack placed haphazardly on a slatted wooden park bench. <br/>
The bench's backrest is painted green. <br/>
All the bags' pockets are open, revealing their contents. <br/>
The smallest pocket holds a calculator, while the middle pocket contains a pair of teal-colored scissors, a ruler, colored markers, a sketchbook, and a watercolor paint palette. <br/>
In the largest main pocket at the top of the bag, two ring-bound notebooks with pink and purple covers are visible. <br/>
All the pocket zippers have black straps with red logos. <br/>
Since there are no valuables or luxury items, it may be safe from theft even when left open carelessly. <br/>
You know, this backpack must belong to a budding artist!<br/>
