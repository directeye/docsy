## Exercise 1: Shopping

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
In the photo, a mother is accompanied by her baby daughter in a supermarket's fresh produce section.<br/>
Seated in a blue shopping cart, the little one fidgets behind her mother as she reaches for a canary melon.<br/>
The baby is clearly eager to touch it and is reaching out with her tiny right hand.<br/>
<br/>
Despite a warm smile, the mother's mind is busy figuring out how to indulge her daughter's curiosity without triggering any tears. <br/>
Allowing the baby to touch the melon should be fine up to a point but taking it away from her to put in the shopping cart might lead to her crying.<br/>
In that case, the mother is contemplating the need to console her daughter by picking her up, thus not spoiling their happy mood.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Bike Ride with a Pet

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
In the photo, there's a young woman and her dog sitting on a stone bench alongside the park's outer pathway, looking at something.<br/>
The woman is sporting in a straw hat, oversized black sunglasses, a black-and-white striped shirt neatly cinched with a slim red belt. <br/>
She has on shorts, ankle socks, and white lace-up shoes.<br/>
Upon closer inspection, you'll notice the All-Star emblem on the sole of her left footwear, confirming that she's wearing Converse sneakers. <br/>
On her left side, there's a red backpack and a mountain bike.<br/>
The Jack Russell Terrier exudes charm with his drooping left ear and a brown patch on his back.<br/>
He's wearing a red collar, though there's no leash in sight.<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll pause here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In my previous video, I discussed a photo featuring a woman and her dog.<br/>
Now let me share my observations.<br/>
<br/>
The woman seems to be calling someone in the distance, while her restless dog, with his mouth open and tail wagging, remains still, fighting the urge to run up to them. <br/>
After bidding farewell, she'll likely hoist her backpack, leash her dog, and cycle home.<br/>
<br/>
From her light attire and the photo's ambiance, it suggests a summertime setting. <br/>
The tilt of the sunlight and the elongated shadows indicate it's early morning or evening.<br/>
Considering that the stone bench might be too hot in the evening, early morning seems more likely.<br/>
<br/>
The camera lens captures lens flares, caused by strong sunlight, creating hazy, glowing orbs that enhance the dreamy atmosphere.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Rain on a Sunny Day

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
In this photo, a young girl with curly, shoulder-length blond hair is sheltered beneath a large, sturdy handheld umbrella. <br/>
Her fringe gracefully covers her forehead, and she's dressed in a short-sleeved, bright yellow blouse. <br/>
She holds the umbrella's handle with her left hand, its shaft resting on her shoulder, while her right hand is raised, palm upturned, feeling the falling rain.<br/>
The colorful umbrella also complements her outfit, and she seems to relish the gentle, rhythmic sound of raindrops.<br/>
The umbrella's robust frame with numerous ribs completely covers the little girl and keeps her dry.<br/>
However, there's a concern that a sudden gust of wind might agitate her umbrella.<br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll pause here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In my previous video, I described a girl standing in the rain with a large umbrella.<br/>
Now, let's turn our attention to the scenery behind her.<br/>
<br/>
The background of the photo appears somewhat blurred, but it features lush greenery and what seems to be vibrant red flowers resembling bougainvillea in full bloom.<br/>
The raindrops falling steadily are clearly visible, enhancing a typical rainy day atmosphere.<br/>
Surprisingly, the sun shines despite the rain.<br/>
Sunlight reaches the thriving leaves just behind her and makes the raindrops glisten on the foliage, creating a beautiful backdrop.<br/>
