## Exercise 1: Street Band

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
This image looks like an album cover for an amateur jazz band performing on a wide street with a good view. <br/>
On the right is a double bass player, on the left is a guitarist, and in the center is a drummer. <br/>
Their facial features aren't visible because we only see their silhouettes. <br/>
All three are wearing fedoras, with two of them in casual jackets and the third in a waistcoat.<br/>
The musicians, their instruments, and the people behind them are in color, while the buildings and cars in the background are black and white. <br/>
The contrasting use of color in this cover art cleverly shows how they bring life to an otherwise dull city.<br/>

## Exercise 2: In the Living Room

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into three parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo captures the grand hall of a luxurious mansion, featuring a striking double-volume space that creates an airy, expansive atmosphere.<br/>
On the large, fluffy rug in the middle of the hall, there’s a marbled L-shaped sofa, a wine-red chaise lounge, and an exceptionally long extra-large sofa, all centered around a coffee table. <br/>
The chaise lounge has a cushion that matches the pattern on the L-shaped sofa.<br/>
The extra-long sofa is actually three sofas connected in a row, adorned with scattered cushions.<br/>
Upon closer inspection, you can see a round single-seater sofa placed to the right of the extra-long sofa.<br/>
Suspended gracefully above the coffee table is a beautiful chandelier, which serves as a stunning focal point in the room.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In my previous video, I described the central area of the living room. <br/>
Now, shifting our focus to the far left behind the chaise lounge, you can see a large potted tree, possibly artificial, along with long curtains that cover all the glass windows on that side.<br/>
In the center, there’s a display with a gas fireplace beneath it, laid with white stones.<br/>
To the right of the living area, behind the long sofa, there’s a hallway.<br/>
And further to the right, you can see a stone wall with a railing that leads downstairs. <br/>
Above this hallway, three windows are visible, likely offering a view into the lounge area from a rooftop space outside.<br/>

{{<card header="**3rd script**">}}
In the last two videos, I've pretty much covered what's in the living room. <br/>
Now, let's wrap up by describing the back right corner and I'll share my thoughts on the room overall.<br/>
<br/>
Behind the pillar at the far end of the hallway on the right, it looks like there's a guest room, and beyond that, a corridor decorated with picture frames. <br/>
Despite the sunlight streaming in from the window on the left, all the lights are on.<br/>
This place feels more like the lounge of a private hotel rather than a private residence. <br/>
The TV in the lounge probably displays hotel information. <br/>
Honestly, they'd probably need a ladder to change the chandelier bulbs, and keeping this place clean must be quite a chore!<br/>

## Exercise 3: Wine and Cheese

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo captures a glass of red wine and an appetizer platter with ham and cheese on a side table against a cracked stone wall.<br/>
In front of the wine bottle caddy, there's some marbled cured meat and an assortment of different cheeses. <br/>
It features Brie, Gouda, blue cheese, and Parmesan.<br/>
On the left, we can see a cheese knife, a tall stemmed glass filled with red wine, and behind that, what appears to be red bell peppers and herbs like dill and parsley garnishing some bread crusts.<br/>
Judging by this photo, it could be a stand-up party reception. <br/>
I don't drink myself, but I'm sure those who dig into this spread would be craving some meat to go with that red wine.<br/>
