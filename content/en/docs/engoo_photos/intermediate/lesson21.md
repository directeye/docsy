## Exercise 1: Let's Go Swimming!

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
In this beach photo all three friends are reveling in the sea spray, raising both of their hands in unison.<br/>
Backlit by the sun, only their silhouettes are visible. <br/>
A woman in a red bikini is at the center, flanked by two men. <br/>
The guy on the left skillfully tosses water, creating a transparent curtain in the sunlight.<br/>
Meanwhile, the guy on the right energetically scoops up seawater with both hands, sending droplets splashing toward the camera. <br/>
Right in front of the lens, you can see those water droplets gracefully returning to the sea, forming a lively and bubbly reaction on the water's surface.<br/>
They seem to be thoroughly relishing in their playful time in the sea.<br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll break.<br/>

In my previous video, I covered the details of the three friends in the sea. <br/>
Now, let's shift our focus to the background. <br/>
<br/>
It looks like the sun is setting, indicating that it's probably turning into evening. <br/>
The waves are remarkably calm and soothing, making it a perfect day for a swim. <br/>
Upon closer inspection, we spot two tiny figures probably swimmers, in between the guy on the left and the woman, with only their floating heads visible.<br/>
In the background on the left side, we can see a mountain range. <br/>
Heading toward the mountains would probably give you a picturesque ocean view.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Movie Night

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo captures a woman lounging on a wooden bed, juggling a smartphone in one hand and a bowl of nearly overflowing popcorn in the other. <br/>
Leaning against the wooden headboard, her head rests on it, and her back is comfortably settled into a thick white pillow.<br/>
One leg is casually stretched out on the bed, while the other, in a slightly bent-knee position, supports the popcorn.<br/>
A closer look reveals a ripped jeans area just above her left knee.<br/>
Additionally, she is wearing a shiny ring on her right hand ring finger as she holds the phone.<br/>
Incidentally, on her left, there's a side table with a white coffee cup sitting on top.<br/>
<br/>
I'll pause here since there's more to explain.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In my last video I talked about the woman posing in this picture.<br/>
Now, let me add my observations. <br/>
<br/>
It's likely she's wearing the hijab for religious reasons, but what struck me is how casually she's dressed. <br/>
That surprised me because my idea was that a hijab is used with formal clothing.<br/>
Additionally, in the picture, she pauses from using her smartphone, offering a relaxed smile to the photographer. <br/>
However, she appears to be simply posing as the subject. <br/>
In reality, with both hands occupied, it seems like she won't be able to indulge in that popcorn.<br/>
If she decides to toss her phone on the bed for a popcorn break, having some wet wipes or napkins around would be a smart move.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Exercise

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo captures a man performing tire flips. <br/>
<br/>
It's uncertain whether he's inside a gym or a garage, but it is very bare as there is no decoration in the area.<br/>
The indoor space has foggy glass, so there's no sunlight streaming in. <br/>
It's also challenging to figure out what time of day it is.<br/>
<br/>
The man in the photo is lifting one side of the tire and is just about to flip it.<br/>
He is shirtless, wearing knee-length black shorts. <br/>
His hands and chin rest on the tire, left foot forward, and right foot stretched back, supporting the weight of the tire with his entire body. <br/>
His well-defined muscles, developed through tire flipping, are noticeable.<br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I'll pause here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In my last video, I mentioned the man working out with tire flips.<br/>
Now, let me add to my observations. <br/>
<br/>
This exercise isn't very common in Japan, and personally, I wasn't familiar with it. <br/>
Lifting the tire from the floor to that position looks incredibly tough, the shine of his perspiration emphasizes its intensity. <br/>
Moreover, I feel like attempting this workout without a well-conditioned body could be risky. <br/>
<br/>
Back in my student days at the Judo club, being smaller and not naturally athletic, I never got into strength training. <br/>
As more of an indoor person, I've realized sticking to my physical limits is safer and a better option for me as I've aged. <br/>
Hence, I prefer lower impact exercises like walking or hiking.<br/>
