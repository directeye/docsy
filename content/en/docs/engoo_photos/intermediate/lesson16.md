## Exercise 1: Healthy Basket

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo beautifully captures a lively mix of newly harvested vegetables neatly arranged in a woven wicker basket with a handle. <br/>
The bountiful selection includes crunchy lettuce, a large zucchini, slender carrots, wholesome potatoes, vibrant red radishes, a delicate spring onion, a glossy eggplant, luscious tomatoes as well as succulent cherry tomatoes on the vine. <br/>
In addition to these, there's tender red cabbage, colorful red and green chilis, firm cucumbers, young green beans, and a single ear of golden corn.<br/>
It's a lavish assortment of vegetables that is astonishingly pristine and gives the impression of a high-quality gift hamper rather than homegrown produce.<br/>
With these ingredients at hand, I can't help but envision savoring not just crisp, fresh salads but also hearty, veggie-packed soups and stews. <br/>
My appetite has undoubtedly been stimulated.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Don't Forget to Smile!

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
In the photo, there's a young woman staring directly into the camera, wearing a beaming smile. <br/>
There are no lines or wrinkles on her forehead or around her eyes, and she appears to be in her late teens or early twenties. <br/>
<br/>
Her hair is styled in loose, dark brown afro curls, with the right side swept back to expose her forehead, and the left side gently falling over her eye. <br/>
It's quite an impressive and attractive hairstyle.<br/>
<br/>
As she smiles, her upper teeth are revealed, but it's a bit challenging to determine whether it's a brave grin or a genuinely joyful expression.<br/>
Nevertheless, her smile in the photo conveys a sense of warmth and a bubbly personality.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Laugh Until You Cry

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo captures a young man in a fit of laughter. <br/>
He's dressed casually in a light blue T-shirt and navy jeans, looking relaxed with unstyled hair.<br/>
It's distinctive that he's wearing slim, rectangular glasses with an elongated frame.<br/>
<br/>
His eyes are shut, mouth wide open, and he's clutching his chest and abdomen, laughing so hard it seems like he might burst. <br/>
His laughter may have brought tears to his eyes, and he might even be struggling to catch his breath.<br/>
<br/>
We can't tell what's tickling his funny bone, but it makes me realize that we don't often express our emotions so openly these days. <br/>
It's truly enviable to be able to express feelings so freely.<br/>
