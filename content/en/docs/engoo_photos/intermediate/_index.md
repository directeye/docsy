  Collection of scripts created for Engoo Photo Description Training at Intermediate Level
---

I write scripts for 1-minute speeches by describing pictures from Engoo designed for intermediate English language learners.

ChatGPT helps me compose these scripts.
Each restricted to about 130 words to fit the 1-minute timeframe.

Due to copyright concerns, I've opted not to embed or reproduce any of the photos used on Engoo on my website.   
Instead, I have included the reference links, so you can view each photo there.
