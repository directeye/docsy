## Exercise 1: Crossing the River

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows a group of five young people enjoying a hike in the woods. <br/>
They’re just about to walk on a large log over a creek, trying to reach the other side.<br/>
The sunlight filtering through the trees creates a warm and pleasant atmosphere, while the sound of the brook adds a refreshing coolness.<br/>
<br/>
The two girls at the front are dressed lightly and aren't carrying backpacks. <br/>
The girl in front has braided hair and is wearing a checkered shirt, while the second girl is wearing a green shirt under a white lace top, paired with blue denim shorts.<br/>
They’re carefully balancing on the log with both arms out as they start to cross. <br/>
<br/>
I'll stop here for now, as the explanation is quite long.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
Previously, I described two hikers crossing the log. <br/>
Let's focus on the remaining three. <br/>
<br/>
Since they're all carrying backpacks, they need to be extra careful not to lose their balance. <br/>
I’m particularly worried about the guy in the middle, wearing a red shirt and beige knee-length shorts, who’s trying to cross in flip-flops. <br/>
While the whole group is dressed casually, flip-flops are especially risky because they can easily slip off the log, causing him to fall into the creek.<br/>
<br/>
Behind him is a blonde woman in a striped sleeveless top and denim overalls.<br/>
At the back is a man with stubble, wearing a plaid shirt and knee-length jeans. <br/>
<br/>
Hiking is fun, but overconfidence can be dangerous. <br/>
The right gear and proper precautions are essential for a safe, enjoyable experience. <br/>

## Exercise 2: Dance!

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a group of five people participating in what looks like a fitness or dance class in a bright, spacious room.<br/>
The woman in front, likely the instructor, has an Afro and a lovely dark complexion. <br/>
She’s wearing a turquoise sports bra and colorful leggings. <br/>
Behind her, the other women sport pastel T-shirts or tank tops with leggings, while the sole man stands on the far left.<br/>
All the participants are performing in sync, with their left foot forward and their arms raised and crossed overhead.<br/>
They appear to be in the midst of an exercise routine, full of energy and enjoying themselves. <br/>
There's probably a large mirror in front of the group, allowing them to check their form as they work out.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Drawing

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows a little girl drawing in a classroom. <br/>
She has long, curly brown hair tied up on the left side with a pink rose clip and is wearing a short-sleeved, button-up shirt with colorful polka dots.<br/>
If you look closely, you'll notice she’s left-handed. <br/>
Her right elbow is resting on the desk, with her cheek propped up on her right fist, as she works on her artwork in a sketchbook with a blue colored pencil.<br/>
In the foreground, there’s a bright orange cup filled with various colored pencils, along with some round containers with colorful caps that might hold watercolor paints. <br/>
She seems really engaged in drawing, so I bet she’s good at it.<br/>
<br/>
I'll stop here, as the explanation is quite long.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video, I talked about the girl drawing. <br/>
Now, I’d like to share my thoughts on drawing.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I'm quite envious of people who can easily draw whatever they imagine. <br/>
When I try to draw something, I don't think anyone would be able to tell what it's supposed to be.<br/>
If I had loved drawing from such a young age, perhaps I would have become skilled at it too. <br/>
But these days, I think it’s amazing that we can describe what we want to draw in words and have AI create illustrations beyond our imagination.<br/>
It’s really a convenient era we live in.<br/>
