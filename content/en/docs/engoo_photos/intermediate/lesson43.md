## Exercise 1: Crossing the River

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows a group of five young people enjoying a hike in the woods. <br/>
They’re just about to walk along a large log over a creek, trying to reach the other side.<br/>
The sunlight filtering through the trees creates a warm and pleasant vibe, while the sound of the brook adds a refreshing coolness.<br/>
<br/>
The two girls at the front are dressed lightly and aren't carrying backpacks. <br/>
The lead girl has her hair in braids and is wearing a checkered shirt, while the second girl is wearing a green shirt under a white lace top, paired with blue denim shorts.<br/>
They’re carefully balancing on the log with both arms out as they start to cross. <br/>
<br/>
I'll stop here for now, as the explanation is quite long.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video, I described the first two hikers crossing the log. <br/>
Now, let's focus on the remaining three. <br/>
<br/>
They’re all carrying backpacks, so they’ll need to be even more careful not to fall. <br/>
I'm worried about the third person, a man in a red shirt and beige knee-length pants, who's attempting to cross in sandals. <br/>
He seems to be taking the hike too lightly. <br/>
Behind him is a blonde woman in a striped sleeveless top and denim overall shorts. <br/>
Bringing up the rear is a man with stubble, wearing a plaid shirt and knee-length jeans.<br/>
<br/>
Hiking is fun, but overconfidence can be dangerous. <br/>
The right gear and proper precautions are essential for a safe, enjoyable experience.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Dance!

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a group of five people participating in what looks like a fitness or dance class in a bright, spacious room.<br/>
The woman in front, likely the instructor, has an Afro and a lovely tan complexion. <br/>
She’s wearing a turquoise sports bra and colorful leggings. <br/>
Behind her, the other women sport pastel T-shirts or tank tops with leggings, while the sole man stands on the far left.<br/>
All the participants are performing in sync, with their left foot forward and their arms raised and crossed overhead.<br/>
They appear to be in the midst of an exercise routine, full of energy and enjoying themselves. <br/>
There's probably a large mirror in front of the group, allowing them to check their form as they work out.<br/>
