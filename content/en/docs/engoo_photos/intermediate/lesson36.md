## Exercise 1: Superheroes Need Sleep Too!

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
In the photo, a man in a bright green superhero costume falls asleep, still fully dressed, gently hugging a fluffy teddy bear. <br/>
His costume is made of stretchy material clinging to his body like a wetsuit.<br/>
The angular goggles with protruding round lenses cover his eyes, with a prominent green inverted triangle between his eyebrows, matching the vibrant shade of his suit. <br/>
Honestly, I don't think the costume looks cool at all, and I wouldn't want to wear it myself. <br/>
But maybe that's what makes it stand out. <br/>
With his short black hair slicked back with gel and a scruffy beard, he might really be resting after his superhero act. <br/>
Seeing him exhausted and seeking comfort from a teddy bear is quite endearing.<br/>
