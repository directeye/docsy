## Exercise 1: On the Subway

{{% pageinfo %}}
This script is devided into four parts.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo captures the interior of a train in Japan.<br/>
It appears to be currently stopped at a station, as seen by the view through the doors and windows. <br/>
The absence of sunlight suggests that it's an underground subway. <br/>
All four passengers are seated, immersed in their smartphones.<br/>
<br/>
Starting from the far-left seat, there's a woman in a white blouse with a short ponytail, wearing a mask. <br/>
She has placed a musical instrument case on the floor and is holding it upright with her knees. <br/>
Her smartphone is resting on top of the case, and she's texting on it with both hands.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
Next to the lady on the far left with the ponytail is an older man with gray hair parted on the left. <br/>
He's wearing a short-sleeved shirt with a suit jacket draped over his right forearm. <br/>
A red file and a business backpack rest on his lap.<br/>
He's deeply engrossed in browsing on his smartphone.<br/>
<br/>
To his left, a woman is seated with black hair, wearing a black and white striped skirt paired with a light blue long-sleeved sweater. <br/>
She's wearing a mask and slouching in the chair. <br/>
Additionally, she's using a paper shopping bag on her knee as a makeshift stand for her smartphone.<br/>
<br/>

{{<card header="**3rd script**">}}
In the seat on the far right, sits a woman with long bangs. <br/>
Her ears are exposed and she isn't wearing a mask.<br/>
She's wearing a wristwatch on her left arm and holding a smartphone with an orange case.<br/>
A pair of wired earphones are plugged into her phone, and she seems to be listening to music.<br/>
Unfortunately, details about her outfit are somewhat unclear due to a red backpack carried by what seems to be a delivery guy in the foreground. <br/>
In front of the four seated passengers, we see a black backpack suggesting it might be being held in front of another passenger's body. <br/>
The absence of advertisements inside the train and the lack of visible handrails in the photo give it a somewhat sterile feel.<br/>

{{<card header="**4th script**">}}
As a cultural note, it's common practice in Japan to hold backpacks in front of oneself to avoid bumping into or pushing others. <br/>
Additionally, due to the ongoing impact of COVID, many people in Japan still wear masks, especially inside trains. <br/>
The absence of advertisements suggests economic challenges, and the reduced number of commuters makes the scene feel somewhat gloomy. <br/>
From the passengers' perspective, a moderate level of crowding is sometimes preferred. <br/>
Having a seat while traveling is obviously more comfortable, but moderate crowding is less likely to lead to incidents of crime, making it a more desirable environment.<br/>

## Exercise 2: In the Car

This script is devided into three parts.

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
In the photo, we see a dapper couple chilling in a convertible, they gaze out from their parked car. <br/>
The man in the passenger seat has well-groomed stubble, his hair is neatly slicked back, and he dons black sunglasses. <br/>
Additionally, he has accessorized with chains around his neck. <br/>
Dressed in a navy custom-tailored suit over a light blue collar shirt, he maintains a refined yet relaxed look by leaving a few buttons undone for a laid-back vibe. 
The woman in the driver's seat has cascading blonde hair with graceful wavy ends. <br/>
Her makeup makes her eyes look lifted, giving off a sharp and intense expression. <br/>
She casually rests her right arm on the man's left shoulder.<br/>
<br/>
(116 words)
{{</card>}}

　

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
Taking a look at the car, we see a shiny, sleek silver two-seater convertible. <br/>
The burgundy leather seats are adorned with a chic diamond-pattern quilted stitch. <br/>
They offer a comfy, custom-molded design that wraps around the body for a snug feel. <br/>
Between the seats, you can spot a parking brake and cup holders that match the leather interior. <br/>
With the passenger-side tinted window down and the convertible roof open, the lush grass behind the car alludes to pleasant weather. <br/>
It seems to be a perfect day for a carefree, open-air, top-down drive. <br/>
However, the reality on the road might not be as smooth. <br/>
They could run into traffic jams or unexpected situations once they start driving.<br/>

{{<card header="**3rd script**">}}
Now, shifting the focus to the passenger seat, the door is wide open, perhaps an invitation for a pet to join them. <br/>
However, the man is wearing a fancy tailored jacket, indicating he's likely concerned about pet fur getting on it. <br/>
Both of their gazes are directed down at something on the ground on the passenger side, but the absence of smiles suggests it may not be a situation where they're waiting for a pet. <br/>
Alternatively, their pet might be hesitant to come out of its kennel, it could be attempting to escape or simply be ignoring their instruction. <br/>
Deciphering the exact nature of this situation becomes a bit challenging.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Let's Take the Scooter

{{% pageinfo %}}
This script is devided into three parts.

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
In the photo, a man with a quiff hairstyle whispers into a woman's ear while holding an acoustic guitar. <br/>
They're both wearing sunglasses and are casually leaning against a yellow Vespa.<br/>
The scooter, with a large transparent windshield, gives it a rounded, streamlined appearance. <br/>
Upon closer inspection, there appears to be a thin white plate behind them attached to the windshield, but I'm not sure what it is.<br/>
<br/>
The man, dressed in a fashionable black leather jacket over a white T-shirt with rolled-up distressed jeans, perches on the scooter seat, balancing on one leg. <br/>
Notably, the guitar strap isn't around his neck, suggesting he's simply holding it rather than playing. <br/>
Perhaps amidst a live music performance, he whispers to her due to the loud surrounding noise.<br/>
<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
Meanwhile, the woman has her hair tied up in a large bun atop her head, dressed in a floral jacket paired with a yellow short skirt that matches the scooter's color. <br/>
However, it might just be a coincidence, as he's the one sitting on the Vespa, creating the impression that he's the scooter's owner.<br/>
<br/>
She leans forward with both hands on the seat and smiles while attentively listening to him, suggesting the possibility of being invited for a drive later on. <br/>
Conversely, if the Vespa were really hers, he might be asking for a ride home.<br/>
It's unclear whether she's enthusiastic about his proposal or simply casually engaged in the conversation. <br/>
<br/>

{{<card header="**3rd script**">}}
Let me mention one more thing I observed. <br/>
I find myself wondering what he does with his guitar when driving with her, as there's no apparent case or space for it to be stowed. <br/>
I think it could be a bit snug for two people to sit on this Vespa without even including the guitar.<br/>
<br/>
Behind him is an old, worn-out yellow container, and directly ahead is a wall mural featuring what appears to be either a massive roller coaster or a suspension bridge. <br/>
The light is bright and throws a gleam across the upper right part of the mural, it also reflects off the black, inorganic concrete floor.<br/>
