## Exercise 1: Flying a Kite

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows a family of three enjoying a kite-flying day in a wide open field. <br/>
They’re all casually dressed in matching white shirts and denim pants. <br/>
With the sunlight coming in at an angle, it looks like it could be early evening in late spring or early summer. <br/>
The mother is the one holding the string, actually flying the kite. <br/>
Meanwhile, the child runs with his left arm raised, looking proud as if he’s the one in control of the kite.<br/>
As for the father, he seems to be jumping, trying to catch the kite mid-air.<br/>
<br/>
I'll stop here for now, as the explanation is quite long.<br/>

In the previous video, I described a scene of a family of three enjoying flying a kite together.<br/>
Now, let's talk about the customs associated with kite flying in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Traditionally, kite flying is a New Year’s activity in Japan. <br/>
There’s even a famous children’s New Year’s song that includes lyrics about flying kites as part of the holiday fun.<br/>
But flying a kite on a cold, windy January day isn't very appealing unless it’s unusually warm and sunny. <br/>
These days, when relatives gather for New Year’s, I think it’s more common to spend time playing video games with cousins than flying kites.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Morning Run

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo captures a couple jogging along a gravel path in a lush park surrounded by trees and greenery. <br/>
On the left, there's a woman dressed in a layered outfit with a pink tank top over a teal one, matching teal shorts, and bright yellow running shoes. <br/>
She’s wearing white wristbands on both arms, though it’s unclear if they’re sweatbands or cooling ice bands. <br/>
Her hair is tied back in a ponytail, and she’s got wired earbuds in, probably listening to music. <br/>
She looks pretty pleased with her best jogging gear.<br/>
Meanwhile, the man on the right is in a fitted blue T-shirt, navy shorts, and white running shoes. <br/>
<br/>
I'll stop here for now, as the explanation is quite long.<br/>

In the previous video, I described a couple enjoying a morning run. <br/>
Now, I'd like to share my thoughts on morning jogging.<br/>
<br/>
Morning jogs are a great way to kick off the day, giving you a burst of energy and setting a healthy tone. <br/>
However, if you push yourself too hard, you might feel sleepy later, so it’s better to keep the intensity moderate to conserve your energy.<br/>
As a side note, outdoor jogging can be tricky since it depends on factors like weather, temperature, and daylight hours. <br/>
If you’re trying to make it a habit, I think hitting the gym or home workout might be a more reliable option.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Ready to Study

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a young girl posing with an armful of books. <br/>
She's standing on a slatted wooden floor, with a dark green chalkboard-style backdrop behind her. <br/>
Wearing a polka-dot long-sleeved blouse and a black skirt, she carries a large red backpack on her shoulders. <br/>
Oversized red glasses dominate her face, and her hair is neatly tied back with a white ribbon.<br/>
It’s a bit of a shame that she needs glasses at such a young age, but she gives off a real bookworm vibe. <br/>
The overall atmosphere suggests she might be a diligent student who takes her studies seriously.<br/>
