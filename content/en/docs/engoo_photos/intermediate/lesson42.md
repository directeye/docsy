## Exercise 1: AFlying a Kite

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows a family of three enjoying a kite-flying day in a wide open field. <br/>
They’re all casually dressed in matching white shirts and denim pants. <br/>
The sunlight is coming in at an angle, so it might be early evening in late spring or early summer. <br/> 
The mother is actually holding the kite string and flying the kite. <br/>
The kid is running with their left arm raised, looking pretty chuffed as if he's the one flying the kite. <br/>
The father seems to be jumping, trying to catch the kite in mid-air.<br/>
<br/>
I'll stop here for now, as the explanation is quite long.<br/>

In the previous video, I described a scene of a family of three enjoying flying a kite together.<br/>
Now, let's talk about the customs associated with kite flying in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
Traditionally, kite flying is a New Year’s activity in Japan. <br/>
There’s even a famous children’s New Year’s song that includes lyrics about flying kites as part of the holiday fun.<br/>
But flying a kite on a cold, windy January day isn't very appealing unless it’s unusually warm and sunny. <br/>
These days, when relatives gather for New Year’s, I think it’s more common to spend time playing video games with cousins than flying kites.<br/>
