## Exercise 1: Let's Drive!

{{% pageinfo %}}
This script is devided into two parts.
{{% /pageinfo %}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo shows a group of six friends enjoying a city drive together in a minivan. <br/>
Two men are in the front seats, two women are flanking a man in the middle-row, and one woman occupies the back seat.<br/>
<br/>
Let me begin by describing the three women in the photo. <br/>
The woman in the middle row, on the passenger side, is wearing a vibrant pink blouse with three-quarter length sleeves and is resting her right forearm on the headrest in front of her. <br/>
Upon closer inspection, a woman behind the driver with shoulder-length dark hair is partially visible with a black and white striped outfit showing, but unfortunately her face is hidden. <br/>
All three women have their hair down.<br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I will break off here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video, I described the appearance of the three women in the car.<br/>
Now, moving on to the description of the men in the photo. <br/>
<br/>
Both the driver and the man in the middle seat are sporting quiffs, along with beards and mustaches.<br/>
On the other hand, the passenger has short hair and is clean shaven. <br/>
While the man in the middle seat is wearing blue mirrored sunglasses and is resting his arm on the woman seated to the left in a familiar manner.<br/>
<br/>
Now, here's something worth noting. The driver is managing to drive with a single hand on the steering wheel, without a seatbelt. <br/>
Similarly, the passenger is talking while facing the back seat, also without a seatbelt. <br/>
I believe it's crucial to prioritize safety while enjoying a trip.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Pregnancy

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
In this picture, there's a pregnant woman sitting comfortably on the sofa, gently embracing her protruding belly with a contented smile.<br/>
She appears to be around 8 months pregnant and seems to eagerly anticipate meeting her baby.<br/>
<br/>
Wearing a light blue cardigan over a white shirt, she keeps herself warm. <br/>
Her light pink tracksuit pants and crossed legs add to her relaxed posture. <br/>
<br/>
To her right, there are three colorful cushions all neatly arranged on the sofa, while on her left side, her elbow rests on a soft white cushion wedged between her body and the armrest.<br/>
Behind the sofa, a shelf displays two potted plants, one of which is lavender.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Easter

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
It appears that a mother posted this photo on social media, featuring her daughter. <br/>
In the picture, we can see her proudly posing while clutching, in both hands, a basket containing the spoils from an Easter egg hunt. <br/>
The girl seems to be delighted, although her face isn't shown in the photo, presumably to protect her privacy and maintain her anonymity. <br/>
She is wearing a white sundress with buttons, along with a thin green belt, and has reddish-brown hair cascading down her right arm.<br/>
The woven wicker basket she's holding is stuffed with curly wood shavings, and there are six eggs inside, each painted in different vibrant colors.<br/>
The background behind her is blurred, but they appear to be in a sunny yard with lush green grass.<br/>
