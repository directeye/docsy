## Exercise 1: Takeoff

{{<alert>}}
This script is devided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo captures the moment when a rocket is blasting off from the steel launchpad tower.<br/>
The thrusters are ignited propelling the rocket into the sky with a deafening roar and billows of smoke.<br/>
It is definitely a space shuttle.<br/>
<br/>
The orbiter, equipped with a crew cabin and triangular wings, is securely linked to the central external fuel tank, flanked by two solid rocket boosters attached to each side of the tank.<br/>
Since it's a manned space shuttle, we naturally hope for its safe arrival at the International Space Station (ISS).<br/>
<br/>
The explanation will be long, so I will break here.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In my last video, I discussed the rocket launch captured in this photo. <br/>
Now, let me share my thoughts on space travel. <br/>
<br/>
Though I haven't seen a rocket launch in person, I know a woman who worked at Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, also known as JAXA, which is Japan's equivalent of NASA.<br/>
She once mentioned that during her tenure she had the incredible opportunity to be present for a rocket launch from inside the control tower. <br/>
Usually, people watch launches from a distance, so her up-close experience was unique, leaving me a bit envious.<br/>
<br/>
Space travel offers extraordinary experiences but comes with restricted freedom. <br/>
Astronauts must remain suited up, can't use the restroom, and can't truly relax.<br/>
Personally, I don't have a strong inclination to board a space shuttle.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Sunflower Field

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo captures the expanse of a sunflower field in full bloom, stretching as far as the eye can see.<br/>
Despite the overcast sky, the sunflowers' orientation suggests that on a clear day, the sun would be casting its warm rays from the front.<br/>
<br/>
In the background, out of focus, is a small grove of trees beyond the perimeter.<br/>
As the field of sunflowers extends into the distance, the green sunflower stems and leaves are concealed under a golden flower carpet.<br/>
<br/>
Upon closer inspection, you'll notice that some of the flower heads in the foreground are beginning to wilt, evoking a sense that summer is drawing to a close.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Catching a Taxi

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a man dressed entirely in black waiting for a taxi on the outskirts of a downtown area. <br/>
He's wearing black-framed glasses, a beard and mustache, and hair slicked-back with gel. <br/>
His outfit includes a black suit with a matching tie. <br/>
He's signaling for a taxi with his left arm raised and carrying a black briefcase over his right shoulder, while his right hand is tucked halfway into his pants pocket.<br/>
<br/>
Under an overcast sky, the exact time is unclear, but sparse traffic suggests it's early afternoon. <br/>
In front of a large shopping center with glass facades, there's a bus stop, but buses may be infrequent at this time of the day.<br/>
He may be using a service like Uber to hail a taxi for his next appointment.<br/>
