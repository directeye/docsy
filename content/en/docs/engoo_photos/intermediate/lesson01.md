## Exercise 1: At the Doctor's Office

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a woman attending a consultation with her doctor. <br/>
Morning sunlight shines into the room. <br/>
The doctor, dressed in a lab coat with a stethoscope around his neck, takes notes with a pen and a paper instead of a computer. <br/>
His clean and professional appearance is complemented by his blue tie. <br/>
The woman, her hands clasped on the white desk, seems anxious while discussing her health. <br/>
However, her ability to attend the appointments suggests that her condition is not severe.<br/>

## Exercise 3: A Sick Pet

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
In the photo, we can see a French Bulldog looking disappointed with a blue ice bag on his forehead. <br/>
He actually wanted to go out and play, but it seems like he may have a fever, forcing him to stay home and take it easy. <br/>
The large ice bag is bothering him and hindering his sleep, but he is keeping his eyes closed and remaining still. <br/>
As a side note, it's quite interesting that he has two whiskers growing downward from mole-like spots on his chin.<br/>
