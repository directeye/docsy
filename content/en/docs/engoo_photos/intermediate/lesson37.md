## Exercise 1: A Busy Morning

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a businessman sitting in an outdoor café, holding a coffee cup and reading a tablet. <br/>
He has short black hair gelled back, a trimmed beard, and a pair of glasses. <br/>
He's wearing a black suit and tie. <br/>
He looks relaxed, sitting with his legs crossed and using his knee to support the tablet, possibly checking the news or emails. <br/>
There's a newspaper on the table in front of him. <br/>
He might be using the café to pass the time while waiting for a train or bus. <br/>
Personally, I avoid doing that because I might get too absorbed and miss my bus or train. <br/>
I only use cafés like this when meeting someone.<br/>
