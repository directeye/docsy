## Exercise 1: A Busy Morning

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a businessman relaxing at an outdoor café. <br/>
He’s holding an espresso cup in one hand and is about to take a sip while scrolling through his tablet with his other hand.<br/>
He has short black hair that is slicked back and a trimmed beard.<br/>
Wearing glasses, a black suit and tie, he looks at ease, sitting with his legs crossed and using his knee as a tablet stand, probably catching up on news or emails. <br/>
There's a newspaper on the table, and the greenery through the window adds a serene touch. <br/>
Personally, I avoid doing this because I’d likely get too engrossed and miss my ride.<br/>
I only use spots like this if I’ve arrived very early for meeting up with someone and need to kill some time before we meet.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Cat Lover

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
In the photo, a woman with dark, wavy curly hair is sitting on a slatted kitchen floor with her bottom resting on the slats, surrounded by white cupboards. <br/>
She's holding a cat in her arms close to her face and is trying to kiss it.<br/>
She’s casually dressed in a white, lightweight romper that is short and fitted and has long sleeves.<br/>
Bright sunlight streams in through the far windows, creating a cozy atmosphere.<br/>
Barefoot with her knees slightly bent, she cradles the cat on her lap, gently holding it under its front legs with both hands. <br/>
As she leans in for a kiss, the cat stretches out its front paws, seeming to resist. <br/>
The snapshot clearly shows how deeply loved and pampered this cat is.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Burgers

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
This burger spread looks hearty and healthy!<br/>
The muted orange plate holds two juicy burgers and a side salad. <br/>
The burgers are stacked high with sesame seed buns, fresh lettuce, crispy patties, a tartar sauce, and thick tomato slices. <br/>
On the side, there's a small white bowl filled with a simple salad of chopped lettuce and tomatoes, adding a nice touch of green to the meal.<br/>
This setup is perfect for two people to share, with each person enjoying their own burger and splitting the salad. <br/>
Although, I think it would be even better with some fries on the side. <br/>
They would really complete this delightful spread!<br/>
