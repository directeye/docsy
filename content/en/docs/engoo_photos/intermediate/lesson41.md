## Exercise 1: A Seminar

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo captures a speaker giving a presentation in a seminar room. <br/>
Through the glass windows in the back, you can see it’s bright outside.<br/>
Blackout curtains are partially raised on the upper windows, and the room is brightly lit with fluorescent lights. <br/>
The speaker in the foreground is dressed sharply in a navy suit with well-groomed hair, delivering an enthusiastic speech to a packed audience. <br/>
The attendees seem to be listening quietly and attentively, which might be motivating the speaker to be even more animated.<br/>
The audience is a mix of different age groups, so this could be some kind of financial planning seminar for various life stages.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Riding Through the Market

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo captures an elderly couple riding together on a bicycle, passing through what looks like a weekend market in a town square.<br/>
On both sides of the market street, there are stalls set up selling clothes. <br/>
The shadows cast by these stalls are pretty short, so it's probably around midday.<br/>
Based on how the elderly couple is dressed, and one of the two blurry figures in the background wearing a black long coat, it seems to be late autumn or winter.<br/>
<br/>
I'll stop here for now, as the explanation is quite long.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video, I discussed the market scene. <br/>
Now, let’s focus on the elderly couple on the bicycle.<br/>
<br/>
The man, bald on top with white hair on the sides, is wearing a tracksuit top with a wide navy line. <br/>
The woman, with red-framed glasses, has on a denim vest, khaki pants, and a scarf. <br/>
While he's pedaling, his hands are holding the woman's waist instead of gripping the handlebars. <br/>
She's perched on the front frame with her legs stretched out to the left side but is steering the bike with a firm grip on the handlebars.<br/>
Their teamwork might be very skillful, but it looks like they need to keep a certain speed to maintain their balance.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Silly in the Pool

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo captures a little girl in a pool, striking a playful pose. <br/>
She's wearing a blue and white striped swimsuit. <br/>
Her short, scraggly blonde hair frames her face, which is adorned with oversized heart-shaped sunglasses with yellow rims. <br/>
Her mouth is wide open, and she's sticking her tongue out. <br/>
Both of her hands are raised with fingers, painted in green, yellow, and red, spread wide to mimic a big head, while she's showing off a smiley face painted on her palms on either side of her face.<br/>
The background is a clear blue swimming pool, enhancing the summery and vibrant feel of the scene.<br/>
Interestingly, her upper body is completely dry, suggesting someone gently placed her into the pool.<br/>
