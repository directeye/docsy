## Exercise 1: It's a Deal!

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo captures a joyful moment in front of a house, celebrating the completion of a new home purchase. <br/>
The couple, likely husband and wife, stand close together, smiling warmly. <br/>
The man is dressed in a light gray t-shirt and jeans, while the woman is in a white top and jeans, both casually dressed. <br/>
The woman has her arm around the man's waist from behind, showing their closeness. <br/>
Directly in front of them stands a lady who appears to be their real estate agent who looks polished in a dark blazer.<br/>
She's shaking hands with the man, sealing the deal with a smile. <br/>
In her other hand is a red folder, probably containing the freshly signed paperwork.<br/>
<br/>
I'll stop here, as the explanation is quite long.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video, I described a couple shaking hands with a female real estate agent after purchasing a new home. <br/>
Now, let’s focus on the background.<br/>
<br/>
This classic brick home has a warm, sturdy appearance with light-colored bricks. <br/>
The entrance features a large white-framed door, flanked by matching rectangular windows that let natural light pour in, beautifully complementing the brickwork. <br/>
The front yard is well-maintained, with neatly trimmed greenery lining the stone steps leading up to the entrance, adding a touch of nature to the facade. <br/>
At the bottom of the steps, a lawn with a “Sold” sticker on a "For Sale" sign signals the finalized deal. <br/>
Their beaming smiles reflect their excitement about starting a new chapter in their very own home.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Fast Food

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a friendly woman serving at a fast food restaurant.<br/>
Her light brown hair is tied back in a ponytail, and she's wearing a light-colored shirt with a red apron uniform. <br/>
Standing behind the counter, she's smiling warmly while handing a customer an orange tray. <br/>
The tray holds two round black plates with transparent lids, though the food is unclear. <br/>
A blurry menu board is visible in the background. <br/>
The type of food served isn't apparent, but the setup is typical for a fast food establishment. <br/>
The photo doesn't reveal the dining area or any queues, so it's hard to tell how busy the restaurant is. <br/>
The woman is the only visible staff member, suggesting a calm moment in the restaurant’s operations.<br/>

## Exercise 3: What Did You Say?

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo features a woman with red hair tied back, dressed in a light-colored top. <br/>
She’s cupping her right hand behind her ear in an exaggerated listening pose, as if she’s eager to catch every word. <br/>
Her facial expression is almost overly dramatic, with eyes wide open and a gaping mouth conveying extreme surprise.<br/>
It's as if she can't hide her reaction to whatever she's just heard.<br/>
The spotlight seems to be focused on her astonished face, and given how over-the-top her gestures are, this is likely a staged scene.<br/>
It could be a theatrical performance or perhaps a stock photo shoot.<br/>
The image seems designed to humorously capture the idea of being shocked by overheard gossip.<br/>
