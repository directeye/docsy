## Exercise 1: It's a Deal!

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo captures a joyful moment in front of a house, celebrating the completion of a new home purchase. <br/>
The couple, likely husband and wife, stand close together, smiling warmly. <br/>
The man is dressed in a light gray t-shirt and jeans, while the woman is in a white top and jeans, both casually dressed. <br/>
The woman has her arm around the man's waist from behind, showing their closeness. <br/>
Across from them stands a woman who appears to be their real estate agent, looking polished in a dark blazer. <br/>
She's shaking hands with the man, sealing the deal with a smile. <br/>
In her other hand is a red folder, probably containing the freshly signed paperwork.<br/>
<br/>
I'll stop here, as the explanation is quite long.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video, I described a couple shaking hands with a female real estate agent after purchasing a new home. <br/>
Now, let’s focus on the background.<br/>
<br/>
This classic brick home has a warm, sturdy appearance with light-colored bricks. <br/>
The entrance features a large white-framed door, flanked by matching rectangular windows that let natural light pour in, beautifully complementing the brickwork. <br/>
The front yard is well-maintained, with neatly trimmed greenery lining the stone steps leading up to the entrance, adding a touch of nature to the facade. <br/>
At the bottom of the steps, a lawn with a “Sold” sticker on a "For Sale" sign signals the finalized deal. <br/>
Their beaming smiles reflect their excitement about starting a new chapter in their very own home.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Fast Food

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo captures a friendly woman serving at a fast food restaurant. <br/>
Her light brown hair is neatly tied back in a ponytail. <br/>
She’s dressed in a light-colored collared shirt and a red apron, which is part of the restaurant’s uniform.<br/>
Behind the counter, she's warmly smiling while handing a customer an orange tray holding two round black plates with clear lids.<br/>
In the background, there's a menu board, though its text is unreadable. <br/>
While it’s unclear what type of fast food is served, the setup looks typical of such a place. <br/>
The dining area and registers aren’t visible, making it hard to gauge how busy the restaurant is. <br/>
Since she’s the only person behind the counter, the photo likely captures a quieter, more relaxed moment.<br/>
