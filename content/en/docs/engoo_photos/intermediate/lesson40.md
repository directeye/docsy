## Exercise 1: Cheater

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows three people sitting on a bench in what looks like an outdoor rest area in a shopping district. <br/>
The couple on the left seems to be in a relationship, gazing into each other's eyes. <br/>
However, the man is holding hands with a red-haired woman sitting behind his girlfriend. <br/>
The girlfriend doesn't seem to notice. <br/>
Often in these situations, the two women are depicted as best friends. <br/>
I don't see why they'd hold hands in broad daylight where they could easily be seen, but maybe they're doing it for the thrill. <br/>
Still, I doubt either relationship will last long.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Soccoer Practice

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo appears to capture a practice session for a local kids' soccer club.<br/>
The coach and all the children are on the field, sitting on the grass in front of the goal net. <br/>
The coach seems to be taking attendance, writing something in a file.<br/>
There are six kids, all wearing blue and white team jerseys, listening intently to what the coach is saying.<br/>
Four of them have soccer balls at their feet.<br/>
The soccer balls and team jerseys still look clean, and nobody's broken a sweat yet, so it looks like they're just about to start their soccer practice.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Smoothie

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo captures a woman in the kitchen about to drink a freshly made smoothie. <br/>
Wearing a red vest over a blue-green, one-shoulder top, she's listening to music through white wired earphones. <br/>
Leaning on the counter with both elbows, sheâ€™s just about to take a sip from the glass in her left hand.<br/>
A black armband on her arm might be holding a music player or smartphone. <br/>
On the counter, there's a blender she used to make the smoothie, a jar of cereal, and some cut fruit on a cutting board. <br/>
Though a bit out of focus, the fruit looks like apple slices and kiwi peels. <br/>
Starting the day with such a healthy routine can really set the tone for a fulfilling and well-rounded day.<br/>
