## Exercise 1: Cheater

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows three people sitting on a bench in what looks like an outdoor rest area in a shopping district. <br/>
The couple on the left are affectionately gazing at each other and seem to be in a relationship.<br/>
However, the man is holding hands with a red-haired woman seated next to his girlfriend, who doesn't seem to notice. <br/>
Often in these situations, the two women are depicted as close friends. <br/>
I don't see why they'd hold hands in broad daylight where they could easily be seen.<br/>
Maybe it's for a momentary thrill, but I doubt either relationship will last long at this rate.<br/>
If being cheated on would upset you, then cheating is not something you should engage in.<br/>

## Exercise 2: Soccer Practice

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo appears to capture a practice session for a local kids' soccer club.<br/>
A coach and all the children are on the field, kneeling on the grass in front of the goal.<br/>
The coach seems to be taking attendance, writing something on a file.<br/>
There are six kids, all wearing blue and white team jerseys, listening intently to what the coach is saying.<br/>
Four of them have soccer balls at their feet.<br/>
The soccer balls and jerseys are still spotless, and nobody has gotten muddy or sweaty just yet, so it looks like they're just about to start their practice.<br/>
The children are still smiling, but once they get out on the pitch, they'll probably be competing for their favorite positions.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Smoothie

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo captures a woman in a kitchen about to drink a freshly made smoothie. <br/>
She's wearing a red top under a blue-green, off-the-shoulder shirt and listening to music through white wired earphones.<br/>
Leaning on the counter with both elbows, sheâ€™s just about to take a sip from the glass in her left hand.<br/>
A black armband on her arm might be holding a music player or smartphone. <br/>
On the counter, there's a blender she used to make the smoothie, a jar of cereal, and some cut fruit on a cutting board. <br/>
Though a bit out of focus, the fruit looks like apple slices and kiwi peels. <br/>
Starting the day with such a healthy routine can really set the tone for a fulfilling and well-rounded day.<br/>
