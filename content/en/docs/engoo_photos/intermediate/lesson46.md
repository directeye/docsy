{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo captures a tender moment between newlyweds on their big day. <br/>
The bride is dressed in a pristine white lace gown that reveals her back. <br/>
Her blonde hair is elegantly styled up, with a long veil flowing behind her. <br/>
Her right hand, draped in the veil, gently rests on the groom’s chest, while her left hand, holding a bouquet of soft-colored roses, wraps around his shoulder.<br/>
The groom cuts a dashing figure in a classic tuxedo, complete with a boutonnière, standing close to her.<br/>
<br/>
I'll stop here, as the explanation is quite long.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video, I talked about the attire of the bride and groom. <br/>
Now, let's focus on the tender moment they're creating together.<br/>
The couple stands in a close, warm embrace. <br/>
Their foreheads and noses are gently touching, creating a picture of intimacy. <br/>
The groom's hands rest softly on the bride's waist as he appears to whisper something, a smile playing on his lips. <br/>
The bride seems captivated, either listening intently to his words or perhaps waiting with anticipation for what comes next.<br/>
The peaceful outdoor setting, likely near water, adds to the scene's romance. Soft, natural light bathes the couple, enhancing the warm and loving atmosphere surrounding them.<br/>
