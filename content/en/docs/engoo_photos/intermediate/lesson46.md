## Exercise 1: Together Forever

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into two parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo captures a tender moment between newlyweds on their big day. <br/>
The bride is dressed in a delicate white lace gown that reveals her back. <br/>
Her blonde hair is elegantly styled and tied up, with a long veil flowing behind her. <br/>
Her right hand, draped in the veil, gently rests on the groom’s chest, while her left hand, holding a bouquet of soft-colored roses, wraps around his shoulder.<br/>
The groom, standing close to his bride, cuts a dashing figure in a classic tuxedo complete with a boutonnière.<br/>
<br/>
I'll stop here, as the explanation is quite long.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In the previous video, I talked about the attire of the bride and groom. <br/>
Now, let's focus on the tender moment they're creating together.<br/>
The couple stands in a close, warm embrace. <br/>
Their foreheads and noses are gently touching, creating a picture of intimacy. <br/>
The groom's hands rest softly on the bride's waist as he appears to whisper something, a smile playing on his lips. <br/>
The bride seems captivated, either listening intently to his words or perhaps waiting with anticipation for what comes next.<br/>
The serene outdoor background seems to be near the water, with soft natural light enhancing the warm and loving atmosphere surrounding them.<br/>

## Exercise 2: No, Thank You!

{{<alert>}}
This script is divided into three parts.
{{</alert>}}

{{<card header="**1st script**">}}
The photo captures an awkward moment between a man and a woman. <br/>
A well-groomed man with a quiff hairstyle and light blue shirt is leaning in, eyes closed and lips puckered, clearly attempting to kiss her. <br/>
It looks like he's brought her to a sunny rooftop or some high vantage point, perhaps thinking it was the perfect romantic setting.<br/>
<br/>
However, the woman, dressed in a teal sleeveless top with lattice-patterned lace that complements her long chestnut hair, is having none of it. <br/>
She’s holding both hands up, gently keeping some distance from him. <br/>
Her body is slightly turned away, and though her eyes are on him, her face is turned in a different direction, unmistakably rejecting his advance. <br/>
<br/>
I'll stop here, as the explanation is quite long.<br/>

{{<card header="**2nd script**">}}
In my last video, I talked about a man attempting to kiss a woman who is clearly rejecting his advance.<br/>
Now, let me share what I think might happen next with these two.<br/>
<br/>
She might be thinking about how to turn him down, calm him, and navigate this uncomfortable situation. <br/>
If he keeps pushing for a kiss, she might end up slapping him across the face and walking away from the scene altogether.<br/>
<br/>
It’s also possible that she simply didn’t like the way his breath smelled. <br/>
In that case, she might shove him away with both hands that are already pointed at him.<br/>
<br/>

{{<card header="**3rd script**">}}
Now, let's consider what might happen next with the man.<br/>
<br/>
First, he might be wondering where he misunderstood the signals when everything seemed so perfect. <br/>
Perhaps he's considering whether his timing was off. <br/>
If he had waited until sunset or when the city lights began to twinkle, the moment might have felt more romantic and less forced.<br/>
<br/>
Still, he'll probably have to set aside the idea of a kiss for now. <br/>
I doubt he'll give up completely, though. <br/>
While he might be feeling a bit embarrassed, he's likely still hopeful about salvaging the date.<br/>
He's probably trying to figure out how to suggest grabbing a coffee without risking another rejection.<br/>

## Exercise 3: Selfie Time

{{<card header="**Script**">}}
The photo shows a young woman with long blonde hair taking a selfie outside.<br/>
She's rocking a wide-brimmed black hat and big round glasses with dark frames. <br/>
Her outfit includes a light green camisole with a leafy pattern and a gray knit cardigan that has slipped off her shoulders and is just hanging on her arms. <br/>
You can tell she's got a good sense of style, mixing casual and trendy.<br/>
In the selfie, she’s sticking out her tongue and her gaze looks upwards to the left, deliberately avoiding eye contact with the camera.<br/>
Looks like she's trying to be goofy on purpose.<br/>
With her right arm extended to hold the camera and her left hand flashing a peace sign, her confident and cheeky pose adds to her charm.<br/>
